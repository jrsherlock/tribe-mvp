- ✅ Gratitude list has more than 2 items

### Visual Cues Applied:
1. **Color**: Blue (#2563eb) instead of gray
2. **Font**: Semibold instead of normal

### States:
- **No Content**: Gray button, no animation

- **Has Content (Expanded)**: Blue button, no badge, no pulse

## 💻 Code Snippets

### Helper Function (CheckInCard.tsx)
```tsx
const hasExpandableContent = () => {
  const hasNotes = mepssCategories.some(category => {
    const notes = checkin[`${category.key}_notes` as keyof DailyCheckin] as string
    const emojis = checkin[`${category.key}_emojis` as keyof DailyCheckin] as string[] || []
    return notes || emojis.length > 0
  })
  
  const hasExtraGratitude = (checkin.gratitude?.length || 0) > 2
  
  return hasNotes || hasExtraGratitude
}
```

### Details Button (CheckInCard.tsx)
```tsx
<button
  onClick={() => onToggleExpand(checkin._id || '')}
  className={`flex items-center space-x-2 transition-colors relative ${
    hasExpandableContent() 
      ? 'text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-700 font-semibold' 
      : 'text-slate-500 hover:text-blue-500'
  }`}
>
  <TrendingUp size={18} className={hasExpandableContent() ? 'animate-pulse' : ''} />
  <span className="text-sm font-medium">{isExpanded ? 'Less' : 'Details'}</span>
  {hasExpandableContent() && !isExpanded && (
    <span className="absolute -top-1 -right-1 w-2 h-2 bg-blue-500 rounded-full animate-pulse"></span>
  )}
</button>
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Old route `/sangha` still works
**Solution**: This is expected. The route still exists in the code. To remove it completely, delete the route from `App.tsx`.

### Issue: Visual indicators not showing
**Check**:
1. Does the check-in have notes in any MEPSS category?
2. Does the check-in have emojis in any MEPSS category?
3. Does the check-in have more than 2 gratitude items?
4. If none of the above, the gray button is correct.

### Issue: Default filter not "Today Only"
**Check**: Line 86 in `SanghaFeed.tsx` should be:
```tsx
const [filterMode, setFilterMode] = useState<'all' | 'today'>('today')
```

### Issue: Buttons in wrong order
**Check**: Lines 425-451 in `SanghaFeed.tsx` - "Today Only" button should come before "Last 7 Days" button.
