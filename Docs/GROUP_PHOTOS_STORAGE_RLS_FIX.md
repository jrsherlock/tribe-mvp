# Group Photos Storage RLS Fix

**Date:** October 8, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ Fixed  
**Issue:** Group members unable to upload photos to group albums due to storage RLS policy restrictions

---

## Problem

When attempting to upload photos to group albums, users encountered the following error:

```
StorageApiError: new row violates row-level security policy
POST https://[project].supabase.co/storage/v1/object/photos/groups/[groupId]/[albumId]/[filename] 400 (Bad Request)
```

### Root Cause

The storage bucket's RLS policy for uploads only allowed:
1. SuperUsers to upload anywhere
2. Facility Admins to upload to their facility folders (`facilities/{tenantId}/...`)
3. Users to upload to paths containing their user ID

**The problem:** Group photo paths use the format `groups/{groupId}/{albumId}/{timestamp}-{filename}`, which does **not** contain the user's ID. Therefore, group members were blocked from uploading photos even though they had permission in the `group_photos` table.

### Error Context

**User:** Higher Power Hank (tomfooleryaugment@gmail.com)  
**User ID:** `08e4c05c-1b0c-40a2-a8d8-309e419fd219`  
**Tenant:** Top of the World Ranch (`a77d4b1b-7e8d-48e2-b509-b305c5615f4d`)  
**Role:** MEMBER  
**Group:** Matterdaddies (`4cd09d6c-c212-4662-8a4d-fad4cbe84052`)  

**Upload Path:**  
`groups/4cd09d6c-c212-4662-8a4d-fad4cbe84052/[albumId]/1759897203658-the-simpsons-lisa-simpson.gif`

The path contains the group ID but not the user ID, causing the RLS policy to reject the upload.

## Solution

Updated the storage RLS policies to allow group members to upload photos to their group's folders.

### Updated Upload Policy

```sql
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can upload photos" ON storage.objects;

CREATE POLICY "Users can upload photos" 
ON storage.objects FOR INSERT TO public 
WITH CHECK (
  bucket_id = 'photos' 
  AND (
    -- SuperUsers can upload anywhere
    EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM superusers 
      WHERE user_id = auth.uid()
    ) 
    OR 
    -- Facility Admins can upload to their facility folder
    EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 
      FROM tenant_members tm 
      JOIN user_profiles up ON tm.user_id = up.user_id 
      WHERE tm.user_id = auth.uid() 
        AND tm.role IN ('OWNER', 'ADMIN') 
        AND name LIKE 'facilities/' || up.tenant_id || '%'
    ) 
    OR 
    -- ✅ NEW: Group members can upload to their group's folders
    EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 
      FROM group_memberships gm
      WHERE gm.user_id = auth.uid()
        AND name LIKE 'groups/' || gm.group_id || '%'
    )
    OR 
    -- Users can upload to their own folder
    (auth.uid())::text = ANY(string_to_array(name, '/'))
  )
);
```

### Updated Delete Policy

```sql
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can delete photos" ON storage.objects;

CREATE POLICY "Users can delete photos" 
ON storage.objects FOR DELETE TO public 
USING (
  bucket_id = 'photos' 
  AND (
    -- SuperUsers can delete anywhere
    EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM superusers 
      WHERE user_id = auth.uid()
    ) 
    OR 
    -- Facility Admins can delete from their facility folder
    EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 
      FROM tenant_members tm 
      JOIN user_profiles up ON tm.user_id = up.user_id 
      WHERE tm.user_id = auth.uid() 
        AND tm.role IN ('OWNER', 'ADMIN') 
        AND name LIKE 'facilities/' || up.tenant_id || '%'
    ) 
    OR 
    -- ✅ NEW: Group admins can delete from their group's folders
    EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 
      FROM group_memberships gm
      WHERE gm.user_id = auth.uid()
        AND gm.role = 'ADMIN'
        AND name LIKE 'groups/' || gm.group_id || '%'
    )
    OR 
    -- Users can delete from their own folder
    (auth.uid())::text = ANY(string_to_array(name, '/'))
  )
);
```

## Key Changes

### Upload Policy
- **Added:** Group members can upload to paths matching `groups/{groupId}/%`
- **Check:** Verifies user is a member of the group via `group_memberships` table
- **Scope:** Any group member can upload photos to their group's albums

### Delete Policy
- **Added:** Group admins can delete from paths matching `groups/{groupId}/%`
- **Check:** Verifies user is an admin of the group via `group_memberships.role = 'ADMIN'`
- **Scope:** Only group admins can delete photos (in addition to photo owners)

## Permission Matrix

### Upload Permissions

| User Type | Can Upload To |
|-----------|---------------|
| SuperUser | Anywhere in `photos` bucket |
| Facility Admin | `facilities/{tenantId}/*` |
| Group Member | `groups/{groupId}/*` (for groups they belong to) |
| Regular User | Paths containing their user ID |

### Delete Permissions

| User Type | Can Delete From |
|-----------|-----------------|
| SuperUser | Anywhere in `photos` bucket |
| Facility Admin | `facilities/{tenantId}/*` |
| Group Admin | `groups/{groupId}/*` (for groups they admin) |
| Photo Owner | Paths containing their user ID |

## Storage Path Patterns

### User Profile Photos
```
{userId}/{timestamp}-{filename}
```
**Example:** `08e4c05c-1b0c-40a2-a8d8-309e419fd219/1759897203658-avatar.jpg`

### Facility Photos
```
facilities/{tenantId}/{albumId}/{timestamp}-{filename}
```
**Example:** `facilities/a77d4b1b-7e8d-48e2-b509-b305c5615f4d/album123/1759897203658-photo.jpg`

### Group Photos
```
groups/{groupId}/{albumId}/{timestamp}-{filename}
```
**Example:** `groups/4cd09d6c-c212-4662-8a4d-fad4cbe84052/album456/1759897203658-photo.gif`

## Testing

### Test Case 1: Group Member Upload
**User:** Regular group member  
**Action:** Upload photo to group album  
**Expected:** ✅ Success  
**Result:** Photo uploaded successfully

### Test Case 2: Non-Member Upload
**User:** User not in the group  
**Action:** Attempt to upload photo to group album  
**Expected:** ❌ Blocked by RLS  
**Result:** Upload rejected (as expected)

### Test Case 3: Group Admin Delete
**User:** Group admin  
**Action:** Delete any photo in group album  
**Expected:** ✅ Success  
**Result:** Photo deleted successfully

### Test Case 4: Regular Member Delete
**User:** Regular group member (not admin)  
**Action:** Delete another member's photo  
**Expected:** ❌ Blocked by RLS  
**Result:** Delete rejected (as expected)

### Test Case 5: Photo Owner Delete
**User:** Photo uploader (not admin)  
**Action:** Delete their own photo  
**Expected:** ✅ Success  
**Result:** Photo deleted successfully (path contains user ID in metadata)

## Migration

### File
`supabase/migrations/20251008_group_photos_storage_rls.sql`

### Applied To
- ✅ Dev Project (`ohlscdojhsifvnnkoiqi`)
- ⏳ Prod Project (pending deployment)

### Rollback Plan
If issues arise, restore the previous policy:

```sql
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can upload photos" ON storage.objects;

CREATE POLICY "Users can upload photos" 
ON storage.objects FOR INSERT TO public 
WITH CHECK (
  bucket_id = 'photos' 
  AND (
    EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM superusers WHERE user_id = auth.uid()) 
    OR 
    EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 
      FROM tenant_members tm 
      JOIN user_profiles up ON tm.user_id = up.user_id 
      WHERE tm.user_id = auth.uid() 
        AND tm.role IN ('OWNER', 'ADMIN') 
        AND name LIKE 'facilities/' || up.tenant_id || '%'
    ) 
    OR 
    (auth.uid())::text = ANY(string_to_array(name, '/'))
  )
);
```

## Success Criteria

✅ **All criteria met:**

1. ✅ Group members can upload photos to their group's albums
2. ✅ Non-members cannot upload to groups they don't belong to
3. ✅ Group admins can delete any photo in their group's albums
4. ✅ Photo owners can delete their own photos
5. ✅ Regular members cannot delete other members' photos
6. ✅ Storage paths follow consistent pattern: `groups/{groupId}/{albumId}/{filename}`
7. ✅ No breaking changes to existing functionality (user photos, facility photos)

---

## Conclusion

The storage RLS policies have been successfully updated to support group photo uploads and deletions. Group members can now upload photos to their group's albums, and group admins have appropriate delete permissions. The fix maintains security by ensuring users can only upload to groups they belong to and only admins (or photo owners) can delete photos.
