## 🐛 KNOWN LIMITATIONS

### Not Yet Functional:
- ⚠️ Search bar (visible but not functional)
- ⚠️ Filter dropdowns (not implemented)
- ⚠️ Actions/CRUD operations (Phase 4)
- ⚠️ Bulk selection (Phase 5)
- ⚠️ Animations (Phase 5)
- ⚠️ Real-time updates (Phase 5)

### Expected Behavior:
- ✅ Tree loads in 1-2 seconds
- ✅ Expand/collapse is instant
- ✅ Detail panel updates immediately
- ✅ No console errors

---

## 💡 DESIGN DECISIONS

### Architecture:
- **State Management**: React useState (will add Context for Phase 4)
- **Data Fetching**: React Query with 5/10 min cache
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Icons**: Lucide React
- **Animations**: Planned for Phase 5 (Framer Motion)

### Component Structure:
- **Main Container**: AdminTreeView (sidebar + content)
- **Tree Nodes**: Recursive TreeNodeComponent
- **Badges**: Separate TreeBadge component
- **Type Safety**: Comprehensive TypeScript interfaces

### Data Flow:
1. Fetch data based on user role
2. Transform flat data → hierarchical tree
3. Render recursive tree components
4. Update on user interaction
