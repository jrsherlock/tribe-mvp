## Root Cause Analysis

### Why Did This Happen?

**Likely Scenario**:
1. **Sept 26, 2025**: First facility created with slug `totw-ranch`
2. **Sept 26-Oct 3**: Two test groups created but never populated
3. **Oct 3, 2025**: Second facility created with slug `top-of-the-world-ranch`
4. **Oct 3, 2025**: All real users, groups, and activity went to the second facility
5. **Result**: First facility became orphaned with empty test data

### Prevention

To prevent this in the future:
1. ✅ Add unique constraint on facility names (if desired)
2. ✅ Add UI warning when creating facilities with similar names
3. ✅ Implement facility merge functionality for future duplicates
4. ✅ Add "Delete Facility" confirmation with data count display
