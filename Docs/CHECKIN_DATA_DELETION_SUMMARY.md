## 🧪 **Next Steps for Testing**

Now that all check-in data is deleted, you can test the "Anonymous" user issue with fresh data:

### Test 1: Create a New Check-in
1. Navigate to `/checkin` in the app
2. Create a new check-in
3. Verify it's shared to "Matterdaddies" group (checkbox should be auto-checked)
4. Submit the check-in

### Test 2: View Dashboard
1. Navigate to `/` (Dashboard)
2. Check "Today's Check-ins" section
3. **VERIFY**: Your check-in appears with your actual name (not "Anonymous")
4. **VERIFY**: Your avatar displays correctly

### Test 3: Multi-User Test
1. Have another user in "Matterdaddies" create a check-in
2. Refresh your Dashboard
3. **VERIFY**: You see their check-in with their actual name
4. **VERIFY**: Their avatar displays correctly

### Test 4: View Tribe Feed
1. Navigate to `/sangha` (Tribe Feed)
2. **VERIFY**: Check-ins from all group members appear
3. **VERIFY**: All user names and avatars display correctly

## 🔧 **Expected Behavior**

With fresh check-in data and the updated RLS policies, you should see:

### Dashboard "Today's Check-ins"
```
┌──────────────────────┐  ┌──────────────────────┐
│  AE                  │  │  HP                  │
│  7/10                │  │  8/10                │
│  Alfred E Newman     │  │  Higher Power Hank   │
└──────────────────────┘  └──────────────────────┘
```

**NOT**:
```
┌──────────────────────┐  ┌──────────────────────┐
│  A                   │  │  A                   │
│  7/10                │  │  8/10                │
│  Anonymous           │  │  Anonymous           │
└──────────────────────┘  └──────────────────────┘
```

## 🐛 **Debugging the "Anonymous" Issue**

The console logs showed:
```
[Dashboard Tribe] Fetching profiles for user IDs: (4)
[Dashboard Tribe] Profiles fetched: [] (0)  ← EMPTY!
[Dashboard Tribe] Profile map size: 0
```

This indicates the RLS policy on `user_profiles` is still blocking access. The issue is likely:

### Root Cause Analysis

**Your user**:
- User ID: `402feaf1-7b9c-4f42-9b6e-1e7cfcef4108` (Alfred E Newman)
- Tenant ID: `null` (solo user)
- Group: Matterdaddies

**Other users**:
- Some have `tenant_id = null` (solo users)
- Some have `tenant_id = 'a77d4b1b-7e8d-48e2-b509-b305c5615f4d'` (tenant users)
- All have `is_public = true`
- All are in Matterdaddies group

**RLS Policy Condition**:
```sql
((is_public = true) AND (tenant_id = get_my_tenant_id()))
```

**The Problem**: 
- `get_my_tenant_id()` returns `null` for you (solo user)
- Other users have `tenant_id = null` OR `tenant_id = 'a77d...'`
- The condition `tenant_id = get_my_tenant_id()` evaluates to:
  - `null = null` → **NULL** (not TRUE in SQL!)
  - `'a77d...' = null` → **FALSE**

**SQL NULL Behavior**: In SQL, `NULL = NULL` returns `NULL`, not `TRUE`. This is why the RLS policy is blocking access!

---

## 🔧 **Fix Required**

The RLS policy needs to handle NULL tenant_id correctly:

### Current Policy (BROKEN for solo users):
```sql
((is_public = true) AND (tenant_id = get_my_tenant_id()))
```

### Fixed Policy (Handles NULL):
```sql
((is_public = true) AND (
  (tenant_id = get_my_tenant_id()) 
  OR 
  (tenant_id IS NULL AND get_my_tenant_id() IS NULL)
))
```

**OR** simplify to:
```sql
((is_public = true) AND (
  tenant_id IS NOT DISTINCT FROM get_my_tenant_id()
))
```

The `IS NOT DISTINCT FROM` operator treats `NULL = NULL` as `TRUE`.

---

## 🚀 **Recommended Fix**

Update the `user_profiles` SELECT RLS policy:

```sql
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Tenant members can view profiles" ON user_profiles;

CREATE POLICY "Tenant members can view profiles" ON user_profiles
FOR SELECT
USING (
  -- Users can always see their own profile
  auth.uid() = user_id
  OR
  -- Facility admins can see all profiles in their tenant
  get_my_role_in_tenant(tenant_id) = 'facility_admin'
  OR
  -- Users can see public profiles in their tenant (handles NULL correctly)
  ((is_public = true) AND (tenant_id IS NOT DISTINCT FROM get_my_tenant_id()))
  OR
  -- Users can see profiles of people in their groups
  (EXISTS (
    SELECT 1
    FROM group_memberships gm1
    JOIN group_memberships gm2 ON gm1.group_id = gm2.group_id
    WHERE gm1.user_id = auth.uid() 
    AND gm2.user_id = user_profiles.user_id
  ))
);
```

**Key Change**: 
- `tenant_id = get_my_tenant_id()` 
- → `tenant_id IS NOT DISTINCT FROM get_my_tenant_id()`

This ensures that solo users (with `tenant_id = NULL`) can see other solo users' public profiles.

---

## 📋 **Summary**

**What was deleted**: 35 check-in records (daily_checkins, checkin_group_shares, feed_interactions)

**What was preserved**: All user data, groups, memberships, photos, goals, auth data

**Issue identified**: RLS policy doesn't handle `NULL` tenant_id correctly for solo users

**Fix needed**: Update RLS policy to use `IS NOT DISTINCT FROM` instead of `=`

**Next steps**: 
1. Apply the RLS policy fix
2. Create fresh check-ins
3. Test if profiles display correctly

---

## 🎯 **Status**

✅ **Check-in data deleted successfully**  
⏳ **RLS policy fix needed**  
⏳ **Testing with fresh data pending**

The database is now in a clean state for testing. Once the RLS policy is fixed, you should be able to create new check-ins and see user names/avatars correctly!
