January 7, 2025

---

## Phase 1: Backend - Database Schema ✅

### Migration File
`supabase/migrations/20250107000001_tribe_community_hub_schema.sql`

### Schema Changes

#### 1. Enhanced `groups` Table
- Added `cover_image_url` (TEXT, nullable) - For group cover images
- Added `created_by` (UUID, FK to auth.users) - Track group creator
- Created index on `created_by` for performance

#### 2. New ENUM Types
- `event_location_type`: 'virtual' | 'physical'
- `rsvp_status`: 'going' | 'not_going'

#### 3. New Tables

**`group_events`**
- Stores group events with full details
- Fields: id, group_id, title, description, start_time, end_time, location_type, location_details, event_image_url, created_by
- Constraints: title length (1-200), end_time > start_time
- Indexes: group_id, created_by, start_time

**`event_rsvps`**
- Tracks user RSVPs for events
- Fields: event_id, user_id, status
- Primary key: (event_id, user_id)
- Indexes: event_id, user_id, status

**`group_photo_albums`**
- Group photo album management
- Fields: id, group_id, title, description, cover_photo_url, created_by
- Constraints: title length (1-100)
- Indexes: group_id, created_by

**`group_photos`**
- Individual photos within albums
- Fields: id, album_id, user_id, photo_url, caption
- Constraints: caption length (max 500)
- Indexes: album_id, user_id

#### 4. Row Level Security (RLS) Policies
All new tables have comprehensive RLS policies:
- **Group Events**: Members can view, admins can create/update/delete
- **Event RSVPs**: Members can view and manage their own RSVPs
- **Photo Albums**: Members can view and create, creators/admins can update/delete
- **Photos**: Members can view and upload, uploaders/admins can delete

## Phase 2: Backend - Service Layer ✅

---

## Cross-Cutting Concerns

### State Management
All components follow the established pattern:
```typescript
const [data, setData] = useState<Type[]>([])
const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true)
const [error, setError] = useState<Error | null>(null)
```

### Loading States
- Spinner with descriptive text
- Skeleton loaders where appropriate
- Disabled buttons during async operations

### Error Handling
- Try-catch blocks for all async operations
- Toast notifications for user feedback
- Console logging for debugging
- Graceful degradation

### Empty States
All components include thoughtful empty states:
- Relevant icon
- Clear message
- Call-to-action (when applicable)
- Contextual help text

### Role-Based UI
Pervasive use of `useGroupMemberRole` hook:
```typescript
const { isAdmin, isMember, canManageMembers } = useGroupMemberRole(groupId)

{isAdmin && <AdminOnlyButton />}
{canManageMembers && <ManageMembersMenu />}
```

### Toast Notifications
Consistent feedback for all user actions:
- `toast.success()` - Successful operations
- `toast.error()` - Failed operations
- `toast.loading()` - Long-running operations

### Animations
Framer Motion used throughout:
- Page transitions
- Modal entry/exit
- Staggered list animations
- Hover effects
- Loading states
