# Goal Immutability & Editing Features - Implementation Summary

## Date
October 7, 2025

## Overview
Implemented the principle: **Goal frequency and title are immutable after creation, but description and progress notes can be edited at any time.**

This document covers four feature implementations:
1. ❌ **Removed**: Frequency toggle from GoalDetailModal (users cannot change frequency after creation)
2. ✅ **Added**: Frequency selector in AddGoalModal (set once during creation)
3. ✅ **Added**: Description editing in GoalDetailModal (title remains read-only)
4. ✅ **Added**: Service function for editing progress notes (UI pending)

---

## Core Principle: Immutability

### Immutable After Creation:
- ✅ **Goal Title**: Cannot be changed (prevents confusion, maintains identity)
- ✅ **Goal Frequency**: Cannot be changed (prevents streak calculation issues)

### Editable Anytime:
- ✅ **Goal Description**: Can be updated (allows refinement without breaking identity)
- ✅ **Progress Notes**: Can be edited (allows corrections and additions)

### Rationale:
- **Title**: Changing the title would confuse users and break references
- **Frequency**: Changing frequency would invalidate streak calculations and progress history
- **Description**: Descriptive text can evolve without affecting core functionality
- **Notes**: Users should be able to correct typos or add context

---

## Issue 1: Removed Frequency Toggle from GoalDetailModal ❌

### What Was Removed:
1. **Frequency Toggle Section**: Entire UI section with "Switch to Daily/Weekly" button
2. **handleFrequencyToggle()**: Function that updated goal frequency
3. **updatingFrequency**: State variable for loading state
4. **RefreshCw Icon**: Import no longer needed

### What Remains:
- ✅ Frequency display in header: "Daily Goal" or "Weekly Goal" (read-only)
- ✅ `getFrequencyLabel()` function (still used for display)

### Code Removed:
```typescript
// REMOVED: Frequency toggle section (lines 225-267)
<div>
  <h3>Frequency</h3>
  <button onClick={handleFrequencyToggle}>
    Switch to {localGoal.frequency === 'daily' ? 'Weekly' : 'Daily'}
  </button>
</div>

// REMOVED: Handler function
const handleFrequencyToggle = async () => { ... }

// REMOVED: State variable
const [updatingFrequency, setUpdatingFrequency] = useState(false)
```

### User Impact:
- **Before**: Users could toggle frequency after creation (caused confusion)
- **After**: Frequency is read-only after creation (clear and consistent)

---

## Issue 2: Added Frequency Selector to AddGoalModal ✅

### Implementation:
Added a clear, user-friendly frequency selector when creating a new goal.

### UI Design:
```
Check-in Frequency
Choose how often you want to track progress. This cannot be changed after creation.

┌─────────────────┐  ┌─────────────────┐
│ Daily           │  │ Weekly          │
│ Track progress  │  │ Track progress  │
│ every day       │  │ once per week   │
└─────────────────┘  └─────────────────┘
```

### Features:
- **Two Options**: Daily and Weekly (Monthly excluded)
- **Visual Feedback**: Selected option highlighted with accent color
- **Descriptive Text**: Each option explains what it means
- **Warning Message**: "This cannot be changed after creation"
- **Default**: Daily (most common for recovery goals)

### Code:
```typescript
<div>
  <label>Check-in Frequency</label>
  <p className="text-xs">
    Choose how often you want to track progress. 
    This cannot be changed after creation.
  </p>
  <div className="grid grid-cols-2 gap-3">
    <button onClick={() => setFormData({ ...formData, frequency: 'daily' })}>
      <span>Daily</span>
      <span>Track progress every day</span>
    </button>
    <button onClick={() => setFormData({ ...formData, frequency: 'weekly' })}>
      <span>Weekly</span>
      <span>Track progress once per week</span>
    </button>
  </div>
</div>
```

### User Flow:
1. User clicks "+ Add New Goal"
2. Modal opens with form
3. User enters title and description
4. User selects frequency: Daily or Weekly
5. User sets privacy (Private/Public)
6. User clicks "Create Goal"
7. Goal created with selected frequency (immutable)

---

## Issue 3: Added Description Editing in GoalDetailModal ✅

### Implementation:
Users can now edit the goal description while the title remains read-only.

### UI States:

**State 1: View Mode (Default)**
- Shows description text (if exists)
- "Edit Description" button enabled

**State 2: Edit Mode**
- Shows read-only title field (grayed out)
- Shows editable description textarea
- Character counter (0/500)
- "Save Changes" and "Cancel" buttons

### Features:
- ✅ **Read-only Title**: Displayed but cannot be edited
- ✅ **Editable Description**: Textarea with 500 char limit
- ✅ **Character Counter**: Shows current/max characters
- ✅ **Validation**: Trims whitespace, enforces max length
- ✅ **Loading State**: "Saving..." during API call
- ✅ **Success Toast**: "Goal description updated!"
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Shows error toast if update fails
- ✅ **Optimistic Update**: Local state updates immediately

### Code:
```typescript
// State
const [showEditDescription, setShowEditDescription] = useState(false)
const [editedDescription, setEditedDescription] = useState('')
const [updatingDescription, setUpdatingDescription] = useState(false)

// Handler
const handleEditDescription = () => {
  setEditedDescription(localGoal?.description || '')
  setShowEditDescription(true)
}

const handleSaveDescription = async () => {
  const trimmedDescription = editedDescription.trim()
  await updateGoal(localGoal.id, {
    description: trimmedDescription || undefined
  })
  setLocalGoal({ ...localGoal, description: trimmedDescription })
  toast.success('Goal description updated!')
  setShowEditDescription(false)
}
```

### User Flow:
1. User opens goal detail modal
2. User clicks "Edit Description" button
3. Edit mode activates:
   - Title shown as read-only (grayed out)
   - Description textarea becomes editable
   - Character counter appears
4. User edits description
5. User clicks "Save Changes"
6. Loading state: "Saving..."
7. Success toast: "Goal description updated!"
8. View mode restored with new description

## Issue 4: Added updateGoalProgress Service Function ✅

### Implementation:
Created service function to update progress notes (UI to be added later).

### Function Signature:
```typescript
export async function updateGoalProgress(
  progressId: string,
  updates: {
    note?: string
  }
)
```

### Features:
- ✅ **Authentication Check**: Requires valid session
- ✅ **Permission Check**: Users can only update their own progress
- ✅ **Flexible Updates**: Accepts partial updates (currently just note)
- ✅ **Returns Updated Record**: Returns the updated progress entry

### Security:
```typescript
.eq('id', progressId)
.eq('user_id', session.session.user.id) // Ensures user owns the progress
```

### Usage Example:
```typescript
// Update a progress note
await updateGoalProgress('progress-id-123', {
  note: 'Updated note text'
})
```

### Future UI (Not Yet Implemented):
Will need to create a Progress History view that:
1. Lists all progress entries for a goal
2. Shows the note for each entry
3. Provides "Edit Note" button
4. Opens inline editor or modal
5. Calls `updateGoalProgress()` on save

## Database Impact

### No Schema Changes Needed:
- ✅ `user_goals.description` already exists (TEXT, nullable)
- ✅ `goal_progress.note` already exists (TEXT, nullable)
- ✅ `user_goals.frequency` already exists (enum)

### RLS Policies:
- ✅ Users can update their own goals (description)
- ✅ Users can update their own progress (notes)
- ✅ Permission checks in service functions

---

## User Experience Improvements

### Before:
- ❌ Users could change frequency after creation (confusing)
- ❌ Frequency selector included Monthly (not useful)
- ❌ No way to edit goal description
- ❌ No way to edit progress notes
- ❌ "Edit" button was disabled placeholder

### After:
- ✅ Frequency is immutable (clear and consistent)
- ✅ Frequency selector only shows Daily/Weekly (focused)
- ✅ Clear warning: "This cannot be changed after creation"
- ✅ Can edit goal description anytime
- ✅ Title remains read-only (prevents confusion)
- ✅ Service function ready for editing progress notes
- ✅ "Edit Description" button is functional

## Future Enhancements

### Short-term:
1. **Progress History View**: UI to view all progress entries
2. **Edit Progress Notes**: UI to edit notes on past entries
3. **Delete Progress Entry**: Allow removing incorrect entries

### Medium-term:
1. **Note History**: Track when notes were edited
2. **Rich Text Notes**: Support formatting (bold, lists, etc.)
3. **Note Templates**: Pre-written note templates
4. **Note Search**: Search across all progress notes

### Long-term:
1. **AI Note Suggestions**: AI suggests note content based on patterns
2. **Note Analytics**: Sentiment analysis, keyword extraction
3. **Collaborative Notes**: Share notes with support group
4. **Voice Notes**: Record audio notes for progress
