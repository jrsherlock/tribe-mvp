## Implementation Details

### Lightbox Integration

**Before (Custom Lightbox):**
```tsx
{selectedPhoto && (
  <div className="fixed inset-0 bg-black/90 ...">
    <button onClick={() => setSelectedPhoto(null)}>
      <X className="w-6 h-6" />
    </button>
    <img src={selectedPhoto.photo_url} ... />
  </div>
)}
```

**After (ImageLightbox Component):**
```tsx
<ImageLightbox
  images={photos.map(photo => ({
    src: photo.photo_url,
    alt: photo.caption || 'Group photo',
    caption: photo.caption || undefined
  }))}
  open={lightboxOpen}
  index={lightboxIndex}
  onClose={() => setLightboxOpen(false)}
  onIndexChange={setLightboxIndex}
  onDelete={(isAdmin || photos[lightboxIndex]?.user_id === user?.userId) 
    ? handleDeletePhotoByIndex 
    : undefined}
  canDelete={isAdmin || photos[lightboxIndex]?.user_id === user?.userId}
  onSetCover={isAdmin ? handleSetAlbumCover : undefined}
  canSetCover={isAdmin}
/>
```

### Cover Photo Badge

```tsx
{/* Cover Photo Badge */}
{localAlbum.cover_photo_url === photo.photo_url && (
  <div className="absolute top-2 left-2 bg-yellow-500 text-white px-2 py-1 rounded-lg text-xs font-semibold flex items-center gap-1 shadow-lg">
    <Star className="w-3 h-3 fill-current" />
    Cover
  </div>
)}
```

### Permission Checks

**Delete Permission:**
```typescript
canDelete={isAdmin || photos[lightboxIndex]?.user_id === user?.userId}
```
- Admins can delete any photo
- Regular users can only delete their own photos

**Set Cover Permission:**
```typescript
canSetCover={isAdmin}
```
- Only group admins can set album cover images
- Non-admins don't see the set cover button
