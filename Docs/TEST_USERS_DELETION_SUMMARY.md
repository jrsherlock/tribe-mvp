## 🔍 Data Integrity Verification

### ✅ No Orphaned Records

```sql
Orphaned profiles: 0 ✅
Orphaned group memberships: 0 ✅
```

**Verification**:
- All `user_profiles` have valid `auth.users` references
- All `group_memberships` have valid `auth.users` references
- CASCADE deletes worked correctly
- Database integrity maintained

---

## 🎯 Key Findings from Investigation

### 1. **auth.users vs user_profiles Relationship**

**Relationship Type**: One-to-One with CASCADE delete

```sql
user_profiles.user_id → auth.users.id
  ON DELETE CASCADE
  ON UPDATE NO ACTION
```

**What this means**:
- Each auth user has exactly ONE profile
- Deleting from `auth.users` automatically deletes the profile
- No orphaned profiles can exist
- Data integrity is enforced by the database

### 2. **Why Display Names Are "Empty" in auth.users**

**Answer**: They're not supposed to be there!

- `auth.users` is a **Supabase system table** for authentication only
- It stores: email, password hash, OAuth tokens, session data
- It does NOT store: display names, bios, avatars, or any app-specific data
- **This is correct architecture** - Supabase separates auth from profile data

**Where display names ARE stored**:
- In `user_profiles.display_name` (your application table)
- All 7 remaining users have display names in `user_profiles`
- Your app correctly fetches them via `useAuth()` hook

### 3. **Phone and Provider Type Columns**

**Phone**: 
- Stored in `auth.users.phone` (for SMS auth)
- All your users use email auth, so phone is NULL
- This is normal for email-based authentication

**Provider Type**:
- Stored in `auth.users.raw_app_meta_data.provider`
- All your users show `"provider": "email"`
- This is correct - they all signed up via email magic links

### 4. **Automatic Profile Creation**

**Trigger**: `on_auth_user_created` on `auth.users`  
**Function**: `handle_new_user()`

**What it does**:
1. User signs up → Supabase creates record in `auth.users`
2. Trigger fires → `handle_new_user()` executes
3. Profile created → Uses email username as default display name
4. User starts as solo user (tenant_id = NULL)

**This is why**:
- Every user automatically gets a profile
- No manual profile creation needed
- Display names default to email username (e.g., "shertechai" from "shertechai@gmail.com")

## 📋 Summary of Your User Architecture

### Two-Table System

```
auth.users (Supabase System)
  ↓ (user_id FK, CASCADE)
user_profiles (Your Application)
  ↓ (tenant_id FK, SET NULL)
tenants (Facilities)
```

**User Types**:
- **Solo Users**: `tenant_id = NULL` (6 users currently)
- **Facility Members**: `tenant_id = UUID` (1 user currently in "Top of the World Ranch")

**Current State**:
- 7 total users
- All have valid profiles
- All have signed in at least once
- No test data remaining
- Database integrity maintained
