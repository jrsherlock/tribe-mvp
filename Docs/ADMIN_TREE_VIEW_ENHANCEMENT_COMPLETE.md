## üêõ KNOWN LIMITATIONS

### **Not Yet Implemented:**
- ‚è∏Ô∏è Framer Motion animations (deferred)
- ‚è∏Ô∏è Real-time Supabase subscriptions (deferred)
- ‚è∏Ô∏è Drag and drop (optional, not planned)
- ‚è∏Ô∏è Bulk selection mode (optional, not planned)
- ‚è∏Ô∏è Filter dropdowns (can be added later)
- ‚è∏Ô∏è Mobile responsive design (needs testing)
- ‚è∏Ô∏è Full ARIA labels (basic accessibility only)

### **Reasons for Deferral:**
- **Animations**: Framer Motion adds complexity; current transitions are smooth
- **Real-time**: Requires Supabase subscription setup; manual refresh works well
- **Mobile**: Desktop-first approach; responsive design can be added incrementally
- **Accessibility**: Basic keyboard nav implemented; full ARIA can be added later

## üí° DESIGN DECISIONS

### **Architecture:**
- **State Management**: React useState (simple, effective)
- **Data Fetching**: Custom hook with useEffect
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS (consistent with codebase)
- **Icons**: Lucide React (lightweight, consistent)
- **Modals**: Portal-based overlays with backdrop
- **Persistence**: localStorage (simple, reliable)

### **Component Structure:**
- **Main Container**: AdminTreeView (sidebar + content)
- **Modals**: Separate components for each operation
- **Tree Nodes**: Recursive TreeNodeComponent
- **Badges**: Reusable TreeBadge components
- **Type Safety**: Comprehensive TypeScript interfaces

### **User Experience:**
- **Confirmation**: Required for destructive actions
- **Feedback**: Toast notifications for all operations
- **Validation**: Real-time validation in forms
- **Accessibility**: Keyboard navigation, focus management
- **Performance**: localStorage caching, efficient re-renders
