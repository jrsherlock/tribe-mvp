# Timezone Bug Fix - My Tribe Feed "Today Only" Filter - October 7, 2025

## Summary

**Fixed**: Timezone bug in `SanghaFeed.tsx` causing incorrect check-ins to be displayed when using "Today Only" filter.

**Root Cause**: The component was using UTC timezone instead of Central Time for calculating "today's" date.

**Impact**: Users saw check-ins from the wrong day between 7:00 PM - 11:59 PM Central Time (5 hours daily).

**Solution**: Changed line 156 to use `getCentralTimeToday()` utility function instead of UTC date calculation.

---

## The Bug

### Location
**File**: `src/components/SanghaFeed.tsx`
**Line**: 156 (before fix)
**Function**: `fetchFeed()`

### Problematic Code (BEFORE)

```typescript
// Line 155-156
if (filterMode === 'today') {
  const today = new Date().toISOString().split('T')[0]  // ❌ UTC!
  sinceIso = `${today}T00:00:00.000Z`
}
```

### Why This Was Wrong

**Problem 1: UTC Date Extraction**
```typescript
new Date().toISOString()  // Returns: "2025-10-07T04:30:00.000Z" (UTC time)
.split('T')[0]            // Extracts: "2025-10-07" (UTC date)
```

**Problem 2: Timezone Mismatch**
```
Scenario: Oct 6, 2025 at 10:00 PM Central Time

UTC time:     Oct 7, 2025 at 03:00 AM UTC (next day!)
UTC date:     "2025-10-07" ❌ WRONG
Central date: "2025-10-06" ✅ CORRECT

Result: Shows check-ins from Oct 7 instead of Oct 6
```

**Problem 3: Inconsistency with Dashboard**
- Dashboard uses `getCentralTimeToday()` ✅
- SanghaFeed was using UTC date ❌
- Same user sees different "today's check-ins" on different pages!

---

## The Fix

### Fixed Code (AFTER)

```typescript
// Line 156-157
if (filterMode === 'today') {
  // Use Central Time to match Dashboard and prevent timezone mismatches
  const today = getCentralTimeToday()  // ✅ Central Time!
  sinceIso = `${today}T00:00:00.000Z`
}
```

### Changes Made

**1. Added Import** (Line 11):
```typescript
import { getCentralTimeToday } from '../lib/utils/timezone'
```

**2. Updated Date Calculation** (Line 156):
```diff
- const today = new Date().toISOString().split('T')[0]
+ const today = getCentralTimeToday()
```

**3. Added Comment** (Line 155):
```typescript
// Use Central Time to match Dashboard and prevent timezone mismatches
```

---

## How getCentralTimeToday() Works

**Implementation** (`src/lib/utils/timezone.ts`):
```typescript
export function getCentralTimeToday(): string {
  const now = new Date();
  const centralTime = new Date(now.toLocaleString('en-US', { timeZone: 'America/Chicago' }));
  return centralTime.toISOString().split('T')[0];
}
```

**Step-by-Step**:
1. Get current time: `new Date()`
2. Convert to Central Time string: `toLocaleString('en-US', { timeZone: 'America/Chicago' })`
3. Parse back to Date object: `new Date(...)`
4. Extract date portion: `toISOString().split('T')[0]`

**Example**:
```
Input:  Oct 6, 2025 at 10:00 PM Central Time
Step 1: new Date() = 2025-10-07T03:00:00.000Z (UTC)
Step 2: toLocaleString() = "10/6/2025, 10:00:00 PM"
Step 3: new Date("10/6/2025, 10:00:00 PM") = Date object
Step 4: toISOString().split('T')[0] = "2025-10-06" ✅
```

## Before vs. After Comparison

### Scenario: Oct 6, 2025 at 10:00 PM Central Time

#### BEFORE (Bug)
```
UTC time:     Oct 7, 2025 at 03:00 AM
UTC date:     "2025-10-07"
sinceIso:     "2025-10-07T00:00:00.000Z"

Query filters: created_at >= "2025-10-07T00:00:00.000Z"

Check-in created at 10:00 PM Central on Oct 6:
  created_at: "2025-10-07T03:00:00.000Z"
  Is >= "2025-10-07T00:00:00.000Z"? YES
  Shows in feed? YES ✅

Check-in created at 9:00 PM Central on Oct 6:
  created_at: "2025-10-07T02:00:00.000Z"
  Is >= "2025-10-07T00:00:00.000Z"? YES
  Shows in feed? YES ✅

Check-in created at 6:00 PM Central on Oct 6:
  created_at: "2025-10-06T23:00:00.000Z"
  Is >= "2025-10-07T00:00:00.000Z"? NO
  Shows in feed? NO ❌ WRONG!
```

**Result**: Missing check-ins from earlier in the day!

#### AFTER (Fixed)
```
Central time: Oct 6, 2025 at 10:00 PM
Central date: "2025-10-06"
sinceIso:     "2025-10-06T00:00:00.000Z"

```

**Result**: All check-ins from Oct 6 are shown correctly!
