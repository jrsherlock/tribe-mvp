## üß™ Testing Checklist

### Visual Testing
- [ ] Verify circular progress ring displays correctly
- [ ] Check progress ring color changes at different streak levels
- [ ] Confirm completion badge appears when goal is completed
- [ ] Test hover effects on goal cards
- [ ] Verify Progress Overview displays correct stats
- [ ] Check template section integration
- [ ] Test empty state appearance
- [ ] Verify responsive layout on mobile, tablet, desktop

### Functional Testing
- [ ] Create a new goal and verify it appears
- [ ] Log progress and check streak increments
- [ ] Verify completion badge appears after logging
- [ ] Test that completed goals can't be marked complete again
- [ ] Reach 7-day milestone and verify confetti triggers
- [ ] Check toast messages for regular and milestone progress
- [ ] Test goal deletion
- [ ] Verify template selection flow

### Animation Testing
- [ ] Card entrance animations (staggered)
- [ ] Progress ring fill animation
- [ ] Completion badge spring animation
- [ ] Confetti particle animation
- [ ] Modal open/close animations
- [ ] Hover state transitions

### Accessibility Testing
- [ ] Tab through all interactive elements
- [ ] Verify focus indicators are visible
- [ ] Test with screen reader
- [ ] Check color contrast ratios
- [ ] Verify ARIA labels on progress rings
- [ ] Test keyboard navigation in modals

### Performance Testing
- [ ] Check animation frame rate (should be 60fps)
- [ ] Verify no layout shifts during animations
- [ ] Test with multiple goals (10+)
- [ ] Check confetti performance with 80 particles
- [ ] Verify modal opens smoothly

### Edge Cases
- [ ] Goal with 0-day streak
- [ ] Goal with 365+ day streak
- [ ] Multiple goals completed on same day
- [ ] Logging progress twice in one day (should error)

## üìù Notes

### Design Decisions
- Chose circular progress ring for modern, clean look
- Limited progress ring to 30 days max for visual consistency
- Used spring animations for playful, therapeutic feel
- Integrated templates to reduce friction in goal creation
- Added confetti for positive reinforcement at milestones

### Technical Decisions
- Used Framer Motion for optimized React animations
- SVG-based progress ring for scalability
- Particle-based confetti for performance
- Local state for UI interactions
- Memoized calculations for efficiency

### User Experience Priorities
1. **Clarity**: Make it obvious what to do next
2. **Motivation**: Celebrate every achievement
3. **Simplicity**: Reduce visual clutter
4. **Delight**: Add moments of joy (confetti, animations)
5. **Accessibility**: Ensure everyone can use it
