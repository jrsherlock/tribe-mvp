</div>
```

## üîß Technical Implementation

### ImageLightbox Component API

```tsx
interface LightboxImage {
  src: string;
  alt?: string;
  caption?: string;
}

interface ImageLightboxProps {
  images: LightboxImage[];
  open: boolean;
  index: number;
  onClose: () => void;
  onIndexChange?: (index: number) => void;
}
```

**Usage Example**:

```tsx
const [lightboxOpen, setLightboxOpen] = useState(false);
const [lightboxIndex, setLightboxIndex] = useState(0);

const images = photos.map(photo => ({
  src: photo.photo_url,
  alt: photo.caption || 'Photo',
  caption: photo.caption
}));

<ImageLightbox
  images={images}
  open={lightboxOpen}
  index={lightboxIndex}
  onClose={() => setLightboxOpen(false)}
  onIndexChange={setLightboxIndex}
/>
```

### Cover Photo Selection Flow

1. User clicks "Set as Cover" button on a photo
2. `handleSetCoverPhoto(photoId, albumId)` is called
3. Function calls `setCoverPhoto(photoId, albumId)` service
4. Database trigger `ensure_single_cover_photo` unsets other cover photos
5. Database trigger `update_album_cover_url` updates album's cover_photo_url
6. Local state is updated to reflect changes
7. Toast notification confirms success

### Auto-Selection Logic

**Scenario 1: First Photo Upload**
- User uploads photo to empty album
- Trigger `auto_set_cover_photo` detects photo_count = 1
- Automatically sets `is_cover_photo = true`
- Updates album's `cover_photo_url`

**Scenario 2: Cover Photo Deletion**
- User deletes current cover photo
- Trigger `auto_set_cover_photo` detects cover was deleted
- Automatically sets first remaining photo as new cover
- Updates album's `cover_photo_url`

**Scenario 3: Last Photo Deletion**
- User deletes last photo in album
- Trigger clears album's `cover_photo_url`

## üì¶ Dependencies

**No new dependencies required!**

The lightbox component uses existing dependencies:

- ‚úÖ `lucide-react` (already installed) - for icons (X, ChevronLeft, ChevronRight)

**Benefits of Custom Implementation**:
- ‚úÖ No additional bundle size
- ‚úÖ No version conflicts with React
- ‚úÖ Full control over styling and behavior
- ‚úÖ Lightweight and performant
- ‚úÖ Tailored to our exact needs
