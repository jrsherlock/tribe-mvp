## Architecture

### Database Schema

#### Tables Created
1. **`user_goals`** - Stores user-defined personal goals
   - `id` (UUID, PK)
   - `user_id` (UUID, FK to auth.users)
   - `tenant_id` (UUID, FK to tenants, nullable)
   - `goal_key` (TEXT, unique per user)
   - `title` (TEXT, 1-200 chars)
   - `description` (TEXT, optional, max 1000 chars)
   - `frequency` (ENUM: 'daily', 'weekly', 'monthly')
   - `target_count` (INTEGER, default 1)
   - `is_public` (BOOLEAN, default false)
   - `created_at`, `updated_at` (TIMESTAMPTZ)

2. **`goal_progress`** - Tracks goal completion events
   - `id` (UUID, PK)
   - `goal_id` (UUID, FK to user_goals)
   - `user_id` (UUID, FK to auth.users)
   - `logged_at` (TIMESTAMPTZ, defaults to NOW())
   - `created_at` (TIMESTAMPTZ)

#### RLS Policies
- **user_goals**: Users can only view/modify their own goals
- **goal_progress**: Users can only view/modify their own progress entries

#### RPC Functions
- **`log_goal_progress(p_goal_key TEXT)`**: Server-side function to log goal progress
  - Finds goal by key for current user
  - Creates progress entry with current timestamp
  - Returns the created progress record
  - Uses SECURITY DEFINER for proper RLS enforcement

### Frontend Components

#### 1. **GoalCard.tsx**
- **Purpose**: Display individual goal with streak information
- **Features**:
  - Magic UI-inspired card design with hover effects
  - Number Ticker animation for streak values
  - Current streak and best streak display
  - Total days counter
  - Active today indicator
  - Privacy icon (Lock/Globe)
  - Frequency label
  - Visual progress indicators (dots for first 7 days)
- **Props**: `goal`, `onClick`, `className`
- **Dependencies**: `useGoalStreak` hook, framer-motion, lucide-react

#### 2. **AddGoalModal.tsx**
- **Purpose**: Modal for creating new goals
- **Features**:
  - framer-motion AnimatePresence for smooth entry/exit
  - Form fields: title, description, frequency, privacy
  - Auto-generates goal_key from title
  - Toast notifications for success/error
  - Disabled state during save
  - Form validation
- **Props**: `isOpen`, `onClose`, `onGoalCreated`
- **Dependencies**: framer-motion, react-hot-toast, goals service

#### 3. **GoalsTab.tsx**
- **Purpose**: Main goals view with grid layout
- **Features**:
  - Bento Grid-inspired responsive layout (1/2/3 columns)
  - "Add New Goal" button with Magic UI styling
  - Empty state with call-to-action
  - Loading state with spinner
  - Stats summary card (total goals, daily goals, public goals)
  - Staggered animations for goal cards
- **Dependencies**: GoalCard, AddGoalModal, goals service

#### 4. **UserProfile.tsx** (Updated)
- **Changes**:
  - Added 'goals' to tab type union
  - Added Goals tab button with Target icon
  - Integrated GoalsTab component
  - Updated conditional rendering for three tabs

### Custom Hooks

#### **useGoalStreak.ts**
- **Purpose**: Calculate streak statistics from goal progress entries
- **Returns**:
  - `currentStreak`: Number of consecutive periods with progress
  - `bestStreak`: Longest streak ever achieved
  - `totalDays`: Total number of days with progress
  - `lastLoggedDate`: Most recent progress date
  - `isActiveToday`: Whether progress logged today
  - `loading`: Loading state
  - `error`: Error state
  - `refetch`: Function to manually refresh data
- **Algorithm**:
  - Uses date-fns for robust date comparisons
  - Normalizes all dates to start of day (UTC)
  - Sorts progress entries by date (newest first)
  - Calculates current streak by checking consecutive days
  - Tracks best streak while iterating through history
- **Dependencies**: date-fns, Supabase client

### Service Layer

#### **goals.ts**
- **Purpose**: Client-side service for goal operations
- **Exports**:
  - Types: `GoalFrequency`, `UserGoal`, `GoalProgress`
  - Functions:
    - `listUserGoals()`: Fetch all user's goals
    - `getGoal(id)`: Get single goal by ID
    - `getGoalByKey(key)`: Get goal by key
    - `createGoal(params)`: Create new goal
    - `updateGoal(id, params)`: Update existing goal
    - `deleteGoal(id)`: Delete goal
    - `getGoalProgress(goalId)`: Fetch progress entries
    - `triggerGoalProgress(goalKey)`: Log progress via RPC
    - `createGoalProgress(goalId, loggedAt?)`: Create progress entry
    - `deleteGoalProgress(id)`: Delete progress entry
- **Features**:
  - Proper TypeScript typing
  - Error handling with try/catch
  - Supabase client integration
  - RLS-aware queries

## Design Patterns

### 1. **Magic UI-Inspired Components**
- Number Ticker for animated counters
- Bento Grid layout for responsive card grids
- Smooth animations with framer-motion
- Consistent rounded corners (rounded-2xl, rounded-3xl)
- Shadow and border patterns

### 2. **Tailwind CSS Patterns**
- Primary color palette (primary-*, accent-*)
- Hover states with scale transforms
- Transition utilities for smooth interactions
- Responsive grid layouts
- Utility-first approach

### 3. **TypeScript-First**
- Explicit interfaces for all props
- Type-safe service functions
- Proper enum types for frequency
- No `any` types used

### 4. **React Best Practices**
- Custom hooks for reusable logic
- Controlled components for forms
- Proper cleanup in useEffect
- Loading and error states
- Optimistic UI updates

## User Flow

1. **Navigate to Profile** → Click "Goals" tab
2. **View Goals** → See grid of existing goals with streaks
3. **Add Goal** → Click "+ Add New Goal" button
4. **Fill Form** → Enter title, description, frequency, privacy
5. **Create** → Goal appears in grid with 0 streak
6. **Log Progress** → (Future: Click goal to log progress)
7. **View Streaks** → See current and best streaks update

## Testing Checklist

## Migration Instructions

### 1. Apply Database Migration
```bash
# Navigate to project root
cd /path/to/tribe-mvp

# Apply migration to dev environment
supabase db push --db-url <dev-supabase-url>

# Or if using local Supabase
supabase migration up
```

### 2. Verify Installation
```bash
# Start dev server
npm run dev

# Navigate to http://localhost:5173
# Login and go to Profile → Goals tab
```

### 3. Test Goal Creation
1. Click "+ Add New Goal"
2. Enter: Title="Daily Meditation", Frequency="Daily"
3. Click "Create Goal"
4. Verify goal appears in grid with 0 streak

### 4. Test Progress Logging (Manual)
```sql
-- In Supabase SQL Editor
SELECT log_goal_progress('daily_meditation');
```

## Notes

- All components follow existing codebase patterns
- No breaking changes to existing features
- Fully typed with TypeScript
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Accessible with proper ARIA labels
- Performance optimized with React.memo where appropriate

## Support

For issues or questions:
1. Check diagnostics: No TypeScript errors reported
2. Review migration file for RLS policies
3. Check browser console for runtime errors
4. Verify Supabase connection and auth
