## Verification Checklist

To verify the rebrand is complete, check:

- [x] Package name updated to `tribe-mvp`
- [x] All navigation labels use "Tribe"

- [x] Email templates updated
- [x] All routes still functional
- [x] Code committed to git
- [x] Code pushed to remote repository

## Testing Recommendations

After Vercel deployment completes, test the following:

1. **Navigation**
   - Verify "Tribe Feed" appears in navigation menu
   - Click through to ensure route still works

2. **Check-in Flow**
   - Complete a check-in
   - Verify success toast says "Shared with your Tribe"
   - Verify redirect to Tribe Feed works

3. **Tribe Feed**
   - Verify page title shows "Tribe Feed"
   - Verify welcome message says "Welcome to the Tribe Feed!"
   - Verify description text uses "tribe" terminology

4. **Dashboard**
   - Verify community section says "Tribe Community"

5. **Email Invites** (if configured)
   - Send a test invite
   - Verify email sender name shows "Tribe" or tenant name

## Notes

- The component file `SanghaFeed.tsx` retains its original filename for code stability
- The route `/sangha` is maintained for backward compatibility
- All functionality remains identical - only branding text has changed
- No database schema changes were required
- No breaking changes introduced

## Next Steps

1. Monitor Vercel deployment dashboard for successful build
2. Test the deployed application using the checklist above
3. Update any external documentation or marketing materials
4. Consider updating social media profiles and branding assets
5. Update any third-party integrations that reference "Sangha"

## Rollback Plan

If issues are discovered, rollback is simple:

```bash
git revert bc739d8
git push origin main
```

This will revert all branding changes while maintaining all other recent improvements.
