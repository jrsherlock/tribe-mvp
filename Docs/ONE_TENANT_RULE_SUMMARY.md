# One-Tenant-Per-User Rule: Executive Summary

**Date**: 2025-10-07  
**Status**: ‚úÖ **COMPLETE & VALIDATED**  
**Database**: sangha-mvp-dev (ohlscdojhsifvnnkoiqi)

---

## üéØ Mission Accomplished

The **strict one-tenant-per-user rule** has been successfully implemented and validated across your entire Sangha platform. Every user (except SuperUsers) can now be associated with **AT MOST ONE tenant** at any given time.

---

## ‚úÖ What Was Delivered

### 1. Database Audit ‚úÖ

**Findings**:
- ‚ùå **1 violation found**: User "James Sherlock Cybercade" had 2 profiles but only 1 tenant membership
- ‚úÖ **No multi-tenant memberships**: All users were already compliant in `tenant_members` table
- ‚úÖ **Data integrity issue**: 1 orphaned profile (profile without matching membership)

**Documentation**: `Docs/ONE_TENANT_RULE_AUDIT.md`

---

### 2. Data Cleanup ‚úÖ

**Actions Taken**:
1. Created backup of affected user's profiles
2. Updated valid profile with better display_name and bio
3. Deleted orphaned profile
4. Verified final state: 1 user ‚Üí 1 membership ‚Üí 1 profile

**Results**:
- **Before**: 8 tenant profiles (1 orphan)
- **After**: 7 tenant profiles (0 orphans) ‚úÖ

**Documentation**: 
- `Docs/DATA_CLEANUP_STRATEGY.md`
- `Docs/cleanup_orphaned_profiles.sql`

---

### 3. Database Constraints ‚úÖ

**Implemented**:

| Constraint | Type | Purpose | Status |
|------------|------|---------|--------|
| `idx_tenant_members_unique_user` | Unique Index | Prevent multiple tenant memberships | ‚úÖ Active |
| `validate_one_tenant_per_user()` | Trigger Function | Validate before INSERT/UPDATE | ‚úÖ Active |
| `trigger_validate_one_tenant_on_insert` | BEFORE Trigger | Enforce on tenant_members | ‚úÖ Active |
| `validate_profile_has_membership()` | Trigger Function | Prevent orphaned profiles | ‚úÖ Active |
| `trigger_validate_profile_membership` | BEFORE Trigger | Enforce on user_profiles | ‚úÖ Active |
| `cascade_delete_user_profile()` | Trigger Function | Auto-delete profiles | ‚úÖ Active |
| `trigger_cascade_delete_profile` | AFTER Trigger | Cascade on membership delete | ‚úÖ Active |
| `validate_single_tenant_profile()` | Trigger Function | Prevent multiple profiles | ‚úÖ Active |
| `trigger_validate_single_tenant_profile` | BEFORE Trigger | Enforce on user_profiles | ‚úÖ Active |

**Total**: 9 database-level constraints

**Documentation**: `Docs/database_constraints_one_tenant_rule.sql`

---

### 4. Application Code Updates ‚úÖ

**Files Modified**:

#### `src/lib/services/invites.ts`
- **Function**: `acceptInvite()`
- **Change**: Added validation to check if user already has a tenant before accepting invitation
- **Error Message**: "You are already a member of [Facility Name]. Users can only belong to one facility at a time."

#### `src/components/admin/AssignToFacilityModal.tsx`
- **Function**: `handleAssign()`
- **Change**: Enhanced error handling for database constraint violations
- **Behavior**: Automatically removes user from old facility before adding to new (tenant switch)
- **Error Message**: "[User] is already a member of another facility. Users can only belong to one facility at a time."

---

### 5. Testing & Validation ‚úÖ

**All Tests Passed**:

| Test | Expected | Actual | Status |
|------|----------|--------|--------|
| Unique index exists | ‚úÖ Found | ‚úÖ Found | **PASS** |
| All triggers exist | ‚úÖ 4 triggers | ‚úÖ 4 triggers | **PASS** |
| No multi-tenant users | ‚úÖ 0 violations | ‚úÖ 0 violations | **PASS** |
| No orphaned profiles | ‚úÖ 0 orphans | ‚úÖ 0 orphans | **PASS** |
| No multiple profiles | ‚úÖ 0 violations | ‚úÖ 0 violations | **PASS** |
| Data integrity summary | ‚úÖ All clean | ‚úÖ All clean | **PASS** |

**Final Data State**:
- **Total Users**: 7
- **Tenant Memberships**: 7 (one-to-one ‚úÖ)
- **Tenant Profiles**: 7 (one-to-one ‚úÖ)
- **Solo Profiles**: 0
- **Violations**: 0 ‚úÖ

**Documentation**: `Docs/test_one_tenant_rule.sql`

## üõ°Ô∏è How It Works

### Multi-Layered Protection

The one-tenant rule is enforced at **3 levels**:

#### Level 1: Database Constraints (Strongest)
- Unique index prevents duplicate memberships
- Triggers validate before INSERT/UPDATE
- Cascade delete prevents orphaned data
- **Cannot be bypassed** - even by admin tools

#### Level 2: Application Validation (User-Friendly)
- Checks before attempting database operations
- Provides clear, actionable error messages
- Guides users to correct workflow

#### Level 3: UI/UX Design (Preventive)
- Admin interface automatically handles tenant switches
- Invitation acceptance checks for existing membership
- No UI allows adding to second tenant

## üîÑ Tenant Switching Workflow

**How Users Switch Facilities**:

1. **Admin-Initiated** (via AssignToFacilityModal):
   - Admin selects user and new facility
   - System automatically removes from old facility
   - System adds to new facility
   - User's old profile and groups are deleted (cascade)
   - Success message: "User moved to New Facility"

2. **Invitation-Based** (via acceptInvite):
   - User receives invitation to new facility
   - If already in a facility, invitation is rejected
   - Error message guides user to contact admin
   - Admin must manually move user (see #1)

**Data Handling**:
- Old tenant profile: **Deleted** (cascade)
- Old group memberships: **Deleted** (cascade)
- Old check-ins: **Preserved** (not deleted)
- New tenant profile: **Created** automatically

## üö® Error Messages

### For End Users

**Accepting Invitation While in Tenant**:
```
You are already a member of "Test Facility". 
Users can only belong to one facility at a time. 
Please contact your administrator if you need to switch facilities.
```

### For Administrators

**Attempting to Add User to Second Tenant**:
```
James Sherlock is already a member of another facility. 
Users can only belong to one facility at a time. 
Please remove them from their current facility first.
```

### Database-Level Errors

**Unique Constraint Violation (23505)**:
```
User abc123 is already a member of tenant "Test Facility" (xyz789). 
Users can only belong to one tenant at a time. 
Remove them from their current tenant before adding to a new one.
```

## üîÆ Future Considerations (Out of Scope for MVP)

### User-Initiated Tenant Switching
- **Current**: Admin must manually move users
- **Future**: User can request to switch facilities
- **Requires**: Approval workflow, data migration options

### Data Preservation Options
- **Current**: Old tenant data is deleted on switch
- **Future**: Option to archive or migrate data
- **Requires**: Data export/import functionality

### Multiple Tenant Support (Business Decision)
- **Current**: Strict one-tenant-per-user rule
- **Future**: If business requirements change, could support multiple tenants
- **Requires**: Major architectural changes, new RLS policies

---

## üéì Key Takeaways

1. **Database-First Approach**: Constraints at the database level provide the strongest guarantee
2. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers (DB + App + UI) provide comprehensive protection
3. **User-Friendly Errors**: Clear messages guide users to correct actions
4. **Automatic Cleanup**: Cascade deletes prevent orphaned data
5. **Zero Violations**: Platform is now 100% compliant with one-tenant rule

---

## üöÄ Next Steps

The one-tenant-per-user rule is **fully implemented and operational**. No further action required for MVP.

**Recommended Monitoring**:
- Run audit queries monthly to verify no violations
- Monitor error logs for constraint violation attempts
- Review user feedback on tenant switching workflow

**If Issues Arise**:
- Check `Docs/test_one_tenant_rule.sql` for diagnostic queries
- Review trigger logs in database
- Verify constraints are still active
