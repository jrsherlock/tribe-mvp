- **Project ID**: ohlscdojhsifvnnkoiqi
- **Environment**: Development
- **Method**: Supabase CLI (`supabase db push`)

## Policies Created

### 1. TENANT_MEMBERS Table (3 policies)

#### Policy: `tenant_members_read_own`
- **Type**: SELECT
- **Purpose**: Allow users to read their own membership
- **Rule**: `tenant_members.user_id = auth.uid()`
- **Use Case**: Users can check which tenant they belong to

#### Policy: `tenant_members_read_for_admins`
- **Type**: SELECT
- **Purpose**: Allow tenant OWNER/ADMIN to read all members in their tenant
- **Rule**: User must have OWNER or ADMIN role in the same tenant
- **Use Case**: Facility admins can view all members in their facility

#### Policy: `tenant_members_admin_write`
- **Type**: ALL (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)
- **Purpose**: Allow tenant OWNER/ADMIN to manage members in their tenant
- **Rule**: User must have OWNER or ADMIN role in the same tenant
- **Use Case**: Facility admins can add, update, or remove members

---

### 2. TENANTS Table (3 policies)

#### Policy: `tenants_read_for_members`
- **Type**: SELECT
- **Purpose**: Allow members to read their tenant's data
- **Rule**: User must be a member of the tenant
- **Use Case**: Users can view their facility's name and details

#### Policy: `tenants_admin_update`
- **Type**: UPDATE
- **Purpose**: Allow tenant OWNER/ADMIN to update their tenant
- **Rule**: User must have OWNER or ADMIN role in the tenant
- **Use Case**: Facility admins can update facility name, settings, etc.

#### Policy: `tenants_owner_delete`
- **Type**: DELETE
- **Purpose**: Allow tenant OWNER to delete their tenant
- **Rule**: User must have OWNER role in the tenant
- **Use Case**: Only facility owners can delete the entire facility

**Note**: Tenant creation is handled via the `create_tenant()` RPC function which uses SECURITY DEFINER to enforce superuser-only access.

---

### 3. SUPERUSERS Table (1 policy)

#### Policy: `superusers_self_select`
- **Type**: SELECT
- **Purpose**: Allow users to check if they are a superuser
- **Rule**: `superusers.user_id = auth.uid()`
- **Use Case**: Client-side code can check `isSuperuser()` to show/hide admin features

**Note**: INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE for superusers should be done via service role or a SECURITY DEFINER function to prevent privilege escalation.

## Access Control Matrix

### Tenant Members Table

| Action | Own Record | Admin in Tenant | Other Users |
|--------|-----------|-----------------|-------------|
| SELECT | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚úÖ Yes (all in tenant) | ‚ùå No |
| INSERT | ‚ùå No | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚ùå No |
| UPDATE | ‚ùå No | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚ùå No |
| DELETE | ‚ùå No | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚ùå No |

### Tenants Table

| Action | Member | Admin | Owner | Non-Member |
|--------|--------|-------|-------|------------|
| SELECT | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚ùå No |
| INSERT | ‚ùå No | ‚ùå No | ‚ùå No | ‚ùå No (use RPC) |
| UPDATE | ‚ùå No | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚ùå No |
| DELETE | ‚ùå No | ‚ùå No | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚ùå No |

### Superusers Table

| Action | Own Record | Other Records |
|--------|-----------|---------------|
| SELECT | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚ùå No |

| DELETE | ‚ùå No (service role only) | ‚ùå No |

## Impact on Application

### ‚úÖ Fixed Issues

1. **Tenant Context Loading**
   - Users can now read their own tenant membership
   - `useTenant()` hook will successfully load memberships
   - No more "Load tenant_members error" in console

2. **Admin Dashboard**
   - Facility admins can view and manage members
   - Tenant CRUD operations work correctly
   - Role-based access control is enforced

3. **Superuser Checks**
   - `isSuperuser()` function works client-side
   - Admin features can be conditionally shown

4. **Community Feed**
   - Tenant membership data loads correctly
   - Feed can determine user's groups and permissions

### üîí Security Improvements

1. **Data Isolation**
   - Users can only see data from their own tenant
   - Cross-tenant data leakage is prevented

2. **Role-Based Access**
   - OWNER role has full control (including delete)
   - ADMIN role can manage members and update tenant
   - MEMBER role has read-only access

3. **Privilege Escalation Prevention**
   - Users cannot grant themselves admin roles
   - Superuser status cannot be self-assigned

## Verification Queries

Run these in the Supabase SQL Editor to verify policies:

```sql
-- List all policies on tenant_members
SELECT schemaname, tablename, policyname, cmd
FROM pg_policies
WHERE tablename = 'tenant_members'
ORDER BY policyname;

-- Expected output:
-- tenant_members_admin_write (ALL)
-- tenant_members_read_for_admins (SELECT)
-- tenant_members_read_own (SELECT)

-- List all policies on tenants
SELECT schemaname, tablename, policyname, cmd
FROM pg_policies
WHERE tablename = 'tenants'
ORDER BY policyname;

-- Expected output:
-- tenants_admin_update (UPDATE)
-- tenants_owner_delete (DELETE)
-- tenants_read_for_members (SELECT)

-- List all policies on superusers
SELECT schemaname, tablename, policyname, cmd
FROM pg_policies
WHERE tablename = 'superusers'
ORDER BY policyname;

-- Expected output:
-- superusers_self_select (SELECT)

-- Verify RLS is enabled
SELECT tablename, rowsecurity
FROM pg_tables
WHERE tablename IN ('tenant_members', 'tenants', 'superusers')
  AND schemaname = 'public';

-- Expected output: All should have rowsecurity = true
```

## Next Steps

1. **Test in Browser**
   - Refresh the application at `http://localhost:5174/`
   - Check browser console for errors
   - Verify tenant membership loads
   - Test admin features

2. **Create Test Data** (if needed)
   - Create a test tenant
   - Add test users with different roles
   - Verify access control works as expected

3. **Monitor for Issues**
   - Watch for any RLS-related errors
   - Verify performance is acceptable
   - Check that all features work correctly

4. **Document for Team**
   - Share this document with team members
   - Update onboarding documentation
   - Add to deployment checklist

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise, you can rollback by:

1. **Create a rollback migration**:
   ```bash
   supabase migration new rollback_rls_policies
   ```

2. **Add DROP POLICY statements**:
   ```sql
   -- Drop tenant_members policies
   DROP POLICY IF EXISTS tenant_members_read_own ON public.tenant_members;
   DROP POLICY IF EXISTS tenant_members_read_for_admins ON public.tenant_members;
   DROP POLICY IF EXISTS tenant_members_admin_write ON public.tenant_members;
   
   -- Drop tenants policies
   DROP POLICY IF EXISTS tenants_read_for_members ON public.tenants;
   DROP POLICY IF EXISTS tenants_admin_update ON public.tenants;
   DROP POLICY IF EXISTS tenants_owner_delete ON public.tenants;
   
   -- Drop superusers policies
   DROP POLICY IF EXISTS superusers_self_select ON public.superusers;
   ```

3. **Push the rollback**:
   ```bash
   supabase db push
   ```
