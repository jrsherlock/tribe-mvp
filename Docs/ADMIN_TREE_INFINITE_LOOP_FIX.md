# Admin Tree Infinite Loop Fix

## Date: 2025-10-05

## Problem Summary

The Admin Tree View (`/admin/tree`) was experiencing a critical infinite loop error that prevented the component from rendering properly. The browser console showed:

```
Warning: Maximum update depth exceeded. This can happen when a component calls setState inside useEffect, but useEffect either doesn't have a dependency array, or one of the dependencies changes on every render.
```

This error occurred immediately when navigating to the Admin Tree page, preventing users from:
- Viewing the tenant/facility tree
- Selecting facilities to view their profiles
- Managing groups and users
- Using any admin tree functionality

## Root Cause Analysis

### ⚠️ ACTUAL ROOT CAUSE (Second Investigation)

**The REAL problem** was in `useAdminTreeData.ts` hook, NOT in the AdminTreeView component.

**File**: `src/hooks/useAdminTreeData.ts`
**Line**: 71 (before fix)

```typescript
// ❌ PROBLEM: This runs on EVERY render, creating a new array every time
const treeNodes = data ? buildTreeStructure(data, userRole, userId) : [];
```

**Why this caused an infinite loop:**

1. `buildTreeStructure()` is called **on every render** (not memoized)
2. It creates a **new array object** every time, even if the data is identical
3. This new array reference is passed to `AdminTreeView` as `treeNodes` prop
4. The search `useEffect` in `AdminTreeView` has `treeNodes` in its dependency array
5. When `treeNodes` reference changes, the search `useEffect` runs
6. The search `useEffect` calls `setExpandedNodes` (even if nothing changed)
7. This triggers a re-render
8. Step 1 repeats → **INFINITE LOOP** ♾️

### The Secondary Issue (Also Fixed)

There was also an issue in the AdminTreeView component with two `useEffect` hooks creating a circular dependency:

**useEffect #1 (Line 103)**: Save expanded nodes to localStorage
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  localStorage.setItem('admin-tree-expanded-nodes', JSON.stringify(Array.from(expandedNodes)));
}, [expandedNodes]);
```

**useEffect #2 (Lines 178-226)**: Search and filter logic
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  // ... search logic ...
  
  // Auto-expand nodes that have matching children
  setExpandedNodes(prev => new Set([...prev, ...nodesToExpand]));
}, [searchQuery, treeNodes]);
```

### Why It Created an Infinite Loop

1. **Initial render**: Component mounts, `treeNodes` is populated
2. **Search useEffect runs**: Even with empty search query, it would eventually call `setExpandedNodes`
3. **expandedNodes changes**: This triggers the localStorage save useEffect
4. **State update**: The state update causes a re-render
5. **Search useEffect runs again**: Because `treeNodes` is in the dependency array
6. **Loop continues**: Steps 2-5 repeat infinitely

### The Specific Trigger

The issue was particularly problematic because:
- The search useEffect would **always** call `setExpandedNodes` when there were matching nodes
- Even if the `expandedNodes` set didn't actually change (same nodes already expanded)
- React would still trigger a re-render because a new Set object was created
- This would trigger the localStorage save useEffect
- Which would cause another render cycle

## Solutions Implemented

### Fix #1: Memoize treeNodes in useAdminTreeData Hook (PRIMARY FIX)

**File**: `src/hooks/useAdminTreeData.ts`

**Before (Lines 68-71)**:
```typescript
}, [userRole, userId, tenantId]);

// Build tree structure from flat data
const treeNodes = data ? buildTreeStructure(data, userRole, userId) : [];

return {
  treeNodes,
  // ...
};
```

**After (Lines 68-75)**:
```typescript
}, [userRole, userId, tenantId]);

// Build tree structure from flat data
// Memoize to prevent creating new array on every render (which causes infinite loops)
const treeNodes = useMemo(() => {
  return data ? buildTreeStructure(data, userRole, userId) : [];
}, [data, userRole, userId]);

return {
  treeNodes,
  // ...
};
```

**Also added import**:
```typescript
import { useState, useEffect, useMemo } from 'react';
```

**How This Fixes the Issue:**

1. ✅ **Stable reference**: `useMemo` ensures the same array reference is returned if dependencies haven't changed
2. ✅ **Prevents unnecessary re-renders**: AdminTreeView's search useEffect won't run unless data actually changes
3. ✅ **Breaks the infinite loop**: No new array = no dependency change = no re-render
4. ✅ **Performance improvement**: `buildTreeStructure` only runs when data/userRole/userId actually change

### Fix #2: Conditional State Update in AdminTreeView (SECONDARY FIX)

**File**: `src/components/admin/AdminTreeView.tsx`

Modified the search useEffect to only update `expandedNodes` when:
1. There are actually nodes to expand (`nodesToExpand.size > 0`)
2. The new set is actually different from the previous set

**Before (Lines 224-225)**:
```typescript
// Auto-expand nodes that have matching children
setExpandedNodes(prev => new Set([...prev, ...nodesToExpand]));
```

**After (Lines 224-234)**:
```typescript
// Auto-expand nodes that have matching children
// Only update if there are actually nodes to expand (prevents infinite loop)
if (nodesToExpand.size > 0) {
  setExpandedNodes(prev => {
    const newSet = new Set([...prev, ...nodesToExpand]);
    // Only update if the set actually changed
    if (newSet.size === prev.size) return prev;
    return newSet;
  });
}
```

**How This Helps:**

1. **Early exit**: If no nodes need to be expanded, don't call `setExpandedNodes` at all
2. **Change detection**: If the new set has the same size as the old set, return the old set (prevents unnecessary re-renders)
3. **Stable references**: By returning the previous set when unchanged, React won't trigger a re-render
4. **Defense in depth**: Provides additional protection against infinite loops

## Files Modified

### 1. `src/hooks/useAdminTreeData.ts` (PRIMARY FIX)

**Lines Changed**:
- Line 6: Added `useMemo` import
- Lines 68-75: Wrapped `treeNodes` calculation in `useMemo`

**Changes**:
1. ✅ Added `useMemo` to imports
2. ✅ Wrapped `buildTreeStructure` call in `useMemo` with proper dependencies
3. ✅ Added explanatory comment about preventing infinite loops

### 2. `src/components/admin/AdminTreeView.tsx` (SECONDARY FIX)

**Lines Changed**: 177-234 (search and filter useEffect)

**Changes**:
1. ✅ Added conditional check: `if (nodesToExpand.size > 0)`
2. ✅ Added change detection: `if (newSet.size === prev.size) return prev`
3. ✅ Added explanatory comments

- `useAuth` - User authentication
- `useUserRole` - User role permissions

## Performance Considerations

### Before Fix
- **Infinite re-renders**: Component would re-render continuously
- **Browser freeze**: High CPU usage, browser becomes unresponsive
- **Memory leak**: Continuous state updates consume memory
- **Unusable**: Component completely broken

### After Fix
- **Stable renders**: Component renders only when necessary
- **Responsive**: No lag or freezing
- **Efficient**: Minimal re-renders
- **Usable**: All functionality works as expected

## Prevention Strategies

### Best Practices to Avoid Similar Issues

1. **Always check if state actually changed** before updating:
   ```typescript
   setState(prev => {
     const newValue = computeNewValue(prev);
     if (isEqual(newValue, prev)) return prev; // Return same reference
     return newValue;
   });
   ```

2. **Be careful with useEffect dependencies**:
   - Avoid circular dependencies between useEffects
   - Use `useCallback` and `useMemo` to stabilize references
   - Consider using `useRef` for values that shouldn't trigger re-renders

3. **Conditional state updates**:
   - Only call `setState` when necessary
   - Add early exits for no-op cases
   - Use guards to prevent unnecessary updates

4. **Monitor for infinite loops**:
   - Watch for "Maximum update depth exceeded" warnings
   - Use React DevTools Profiler to detect excessive re-renders
   - Add console logs to track useEffect execution
