## Database Checks

### Verify Membership Created
```sql
SELECT 
  tm.user_id,
  tm.role,
  up.display_name,
  up.email
FROM tenant_members tm
LEFT JOIN user_profiles up ON up.user_id = tm.user_id
WHERE tm.tenant_id = 'your-facility-id';
```

### Check Pending Invites
```sql
SELECT 
  email,
  role,
  expires_at
FROM invites
WHERE tenant_id = 'your-facility-id'
  AND expires_at > NOW();
```

---

## Common Issues

### "Permission denied"
- You're not OWNER/ADMIN of the facility
- Check your role in tenant_members table

### "Invalid invitation"
- Token is wrong or expired
- Create a new invitation

### "Already a member"
- User is already in this facility
- Or user is in another facility (single-tenant constraint)

### User shows as "Unknown User"
- User hasn't created their profile yet
- They need to visit /profile and fill it out

### Invite link doesn't work
- Check Edge Function is deployed
- Verify full URL is copied
- Check invite hasn't expired
