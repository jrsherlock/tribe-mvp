---

## Feature Breakdown

### 1. Drag-and-Drop Upload
**How it works**:
- User drags photos from file explorer
- Drop zone highlights on drag over
- Files processed on drop
- Previews appear immediately

**Code**:
```typescript
<div
  onDragOver={handleDragOver}
  onDragLeave={handleDragLeave}
  onDrop={handleDrop}
  className={isDragging ? 'border-accent-500' : 'border-primary-300'}
>
```

### 2. Photo Previews
**How it works**:
- Create object URLs for selected files
- Display in 3-column grid
- Show filename on each thumbnail
- X button to remove individual photos
- Cleanup URLs on unmount

**Code**:
```typescript
const urls = fileArray.map(file => URL.createObjectURL(file))
setPreviewUrls(urls)

// Cleanup
useEffect(() => {
  return () => {
    previewUrls.forEach(url => URL.revokeObjectURL(url))
  }
}, [previewUrls])
```

### 3. Upload Progress
**How it works**:
- Track upload progress per file
- Calculate percentage: (completed / total) * 100
- Update progress bar in real-time
- Show percentage number

**Code**:
```typescript
setUploadProgress(Math.round(((i + 1) / files.length) * 100))
```

### 4. Error Handling
**How it works**:
- Try-catch around each file upload
- Track failed files by name
- Continue uploading even if some fail
- Show specific error messages

**Code**:
```typescript
const errors: string[] = []
try {
  // Upload file
} catch (err) {
  errors.push(file.name)
}

if (errors.length > 0) {
  toast.error(`Failed to upload ${errors.length} photos`)
}
```

### 5. Batch Upload
**How it works**:
- Accept multiple files at once
- Upload sequentially with progress
- Update album count after all uploads
- Set cover photo if first upload

**Benefits**:
- Upload 50+ photos at once
- Clear progress feedback
- Efficient processing
- Reliable completion
