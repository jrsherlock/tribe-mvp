# Goal Features Update - Note Field & Frequency Toggle

## Date
October 7, 2025

## Overview
This document covers two feature implementations:
1. **Issue 1**: Note field visibility fix and enhancement
2. **Issue 2**: Goal frequency toggle feature (Daily ‚Üî Weekly)

## Issue 1: Note Field Visibility - FIXED & ENHANCED ‚úÖ

### Problem
User reported that the optional note/comment field was not visible when trying to log progress for a goal.

### Root Cause Analysis
The note field was implemented correctly but had a conditional rendering issue:

```typescript
{!isActiveToday && (
  <div className="mb-3">
    {/* Note input */}
  </div>
)}
```

**Explanation:**
- `isActiveToday` is `true` when the user has already logged progress today
- The condition `!isActiveToday` means "only show if NOT logged today"
- This is **correct behavior** - users shouldn't add notes after already logging
- However, if testing with a goal already logged today, the field won't appear

### Solution Implemented

**1. Added Visual Feedback**
When `isActiveToday` is `true`, show an informative message:
```typescript
{isActiveToday && (
  <div className="mb-3 bg-accent/10 border border-accent/30 rounded-lg p-3">
    <p className="text-sm text-primary-700">
      ‚úÖ You've already logged progress today! Come back tomorrow to continue your streak.
    </p>
  </div>
)}
```

**2. Enhanced Note Button Styling**
Made the "+ Add a note (optional)" link more visible:
```typescript
className="text-sm text-primary-600 hover:text-accent-600 transition-colors underline decoration-dotted"
```
- Added underline with dotted decoration
- Makes it clear it's clickable
- Hover changes color to accent

**3. Maintained Correct Logic**
- Note field only shows when `!isActiveToday` (correct)
- User can't add notes after already logging (prevents confusion)
- Clear feedback when already logged

### User Flow

**Scenario A: User hasn't logged today**
1. Open goal detail modal
2. See "Log Progress" section
3. See "+ Add a note (optional)" link (underlined, dotted)
4. Click link ‚Üí Textarea appears
5. Type note (up to 1000 chars)
6. Click "Log Progress" ‚Üí Note saved with progress
7. Success toast appears
8. Note field resets and collapses

**Scenario B: User already logged today**
1. Open goal detail modal
2. See "Log Progress" section
3. See message: "‚úÖ You've already logged progress today! Come back tomorrow to continue your streak."
4. "Log Progress" button shows "Logged Today ‚úì" (disabled)
5. No note field visible (correct - can't log again)

### Testing Instructions

**Test 1: Note field visible (not logged today)**
1. Create a new goal (or use one you haven't logged today)
2. Click on the goal card
3. Verify:
   - ‚úÖ "Log Progress" section visible
   - ‚úÖ "+ Add a note (optional)" link visible (underlined)
   - ‚úÖ No "already logged" message
   - ‚úÖ "Log Progress" button enabled

**Test 2: Note field hidden (already logged today)**
1. Log progress for a goal
2. Close and reopen the modal
3. Verify:
   - ‚úÖ "Already logged today" message visible
   - ‚úÖ No "+ Add a note (optional)" link
   - ‚úÖ "Logged Today ‚úì" button (disabled)

**Test 3: Add note and log progress**
1. Open goal that hasn't been logged today
2. Click "+ Add a note (optional)"
3. Verify textarea appears
4. Type: "Great session today!"
5. Verify character counter: "20/1000 characters"
6. Click "Log Progress"
7. Verify:
   - ‚úÖ Success toast appears
   - ‚úÖ Note field resets
   - ‚úÖ Streak updates
   - ‚úÖ Button changes to "Logged Today ‚úì"

## Issue 2: Goal Frequency Toggle - IMPLEMENTED ‚úÖ

### Feature Overview
Users can now toggle the frequency of existing goals between Daily and Weekly check-ins.

### Implementation Details

#### 1. UI Components Added

**Frequency Section** (in GoalDetailModal)
```typescript
<div>
  <h3 className="text-sm font-semibold text-primary-700 mb-3">Frequency</h3>
  <div className="bg-primary-50 rounded-xl p-4 border border-primary-200">
    <div className="flex items-center justify-between">
      <div>
        <p className="text-sm font-medium text-primary-800">
          Check-in: <span className="text-accent-600">{getFrequencyLabel()}</span>
        </p>
        <p className="text-xs text-primary-600 mt-1">
          {localGoal.frequency === 'daily' 
            ? 'Track progress every day'
            : 'Track progress once per week'
          }
        </p>
      </div>
      <button onClick={handleFrequencyToggle}>
        Switch to {localGoal.frequency === 'daily' ? 'Weekly' : 'Daily'}
      </button>
    </div>
    <div className="mt-3 pt-3 border-t border-primary-200">
      <p className="text-xs text-primary-500 italic">
        üí° Changing frequency will recalculate your streak based on the new schedule. 
        Your progress history will be preserved.
      </p>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```

**Features:**
- Shows current frequency with accent color
- Descriptive text explaining what each frequency means
- Toggle button with loading state
- Informative message about what happens when changing
- Clean, card-based design

#### 2. State Management

**New State Variables:**
```typescript
const [updatingFrequency, setUpdatingFrequency] = useState(false)
const [localGoal, setLocalGoal] = useState<UserGoal | null>(goal)

// Sync local goal with prop changes
React.useEffect(() => {
  setLocalGoal(goal)
}, [goal])
```

**Why Local State?**
- Allows immediate UI update after frequency change
- Prevents flash of old data while parent refreshes
- Provides optimistic UI updates

#### 3. Frequency Toggle Handler

```typescript
const handleFrequencyToggle = async () => {
  if (!localGoal) return

  const newFrequency: GoalFrequency = 
    localGoal.frequency === 'daily' ? 'weekly' : 'daily'

  try {
    setUpdatingFrequency(true)

    // Update in database
    await updateGoal(localGoal.id, {
      frequency: newFrequency
    })

    // Update local state (optimistic update)
    setLocalGoal({
      ...localGoal,
      frequency: newFrequency
    })

    toast.success(`Goal frequency updated to ${newFrequency}!`)

    // Refresh streak data (will recalculate)
    refetch()
    onGoalUpdated?.()
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Failed to update frequency:', error)
    toast.error('Failed to update frequency. Please try again.')
  } finally {
    setUpdatingFrequency(false)
  }
}
```

**Flow:**
1. Determine new frequency (toggle between daily/weekly)
2. Show loading state
3. Call `updateGoal()` API
4. Update local state immediately (optimistic)
5. Show success toast
6. Refresh streak data
7. Notify parent component
8. Handle errors gracefully

#### 4. Supported Frequencies

**Currently Supported:**
- ‚úÖ **Daily**: Check-in every day
- ‚úÖ **Weekly**: Check-in once per week

**Not Included (Future):**
- ‚è≥ **Monthly**: Check-in once per month (exists in schema but excluded from toggle)

**Rationale:**
- Daily and Weekly are most common for recovery goals
- Monthly is less useful for habit tracking
- Can be added later if needed

### User Flow

**Complete Flow:**
1. User opens goal detail modal
2. Sees "Frequency" section showing current frequency
3. Clicks "Switch to Weekly" (or "Switch to Daily")
4. Button shows loading spinner: "Updating..."
5. API call updates goal in database
6. Success toast: "Goal frequency updated to weekly!"
7. UI updates to show new frequency
8. Streak recalculates based on new frequency
9. Button now shows opposite option: "Switch to Daily"

### Validation & Safety

**Progress History Preserved:**
- ‚úÖ All existing progress entries remain in database
- ‚úÖ No data is deleted or modified
- ‚úÖ Streak recalculates using same progress data
- ‚úÖ Can switch back and forth without losing data

**Streak Recalculation:**
- ‚úÖ Automatically triggers `refetch()` after frequency change
- ‚úÖ `useGoalStreak` hook recalculates with new frequency
- ‚úÖ Current implementation counts consecutive days (works for both)
- ‚è≥ Future: Weekly goals could count consecutive weeks

**Error Handling:**
- ‚úÖ Loading state prevents double-clicks
- ‚úÖ Error toast if API call fails
- ‚úÖ Local state reverts on error (future enhancement)
- ‚úÖ Console logging for debugging

### Testing Instructions

**Test 1: Toggle Daily ‚Üí Weekly**
1. Create a daily goal
2. Log progress for a few days
3. Open goal detail modal
4. Verify "Frequency" section shows "Daily"
5. Click "Switch to Weekly"
6. Verify:
   - ‚úÖ Button shows "Updating..." with spinner
   - ‚úÖ Success toast: "Goal frequency updated to weekly!"
   - ‚úÖ Frequency section now shows "Weekly"
   - ‚úÖ Button now says "Switch to Daily"
   - ‚úÖ Streak stats update
   - ‚úÖ Progress history preserved

**Test 2: Toggle Weekly ‚Üí Daily**
1. Use the goal from Test 1 (now weekly)
2. Click "Switch to Daily"
3. Verify same success flow as Test 1
4. Verify frequency is now "Daily"

**Test 3: Multiple Toggles**
1. Toggle frequency 5 times rapidly
2. Verify:
   - ‚úÖ Loading state prevents multiple simultaneous requests
   - ‚úÖ Each toggle completes successfully
   - ‚úÖ Final frequency is correct
   - ‚úÖ No errors in console

**Test 4: Error Handling**
1. Disconnect internet
2. Try to toggle frequency
3. Verify:
   - ‚úÖ Error toast appears
   - ‚úÖ Frequency doesn't change in UI
   - ‚úÖ Button returns to normal state

**Test 5: Streak Preservation**
1. Create daily goal with 5-day streak
2. Note current streak: 5
3. Toggle to weekly
4. Verify:
   - ‚úÖ Streak recalculates (may change based on logic)
   - ‚úÖ Total days remains 5
   - ‚úÖ Progress history intact
5. Toggle back to daily
6. Verify streak returns to original value

### Database Impact

**Schema:**
- No changes needed (frequency column already exists)
- Supports: 'daily', 'weekly', 'monthly'

**API Call:**
```typescript
await updateGoal(goalId, {
  frequency: 'weekly'
})
```

**SQL:**
```sql
UPDATE user_goals 
SET frequency = 'weekly', updated_at = NOW()
WHERE id = '...' AND user_id = '...';
```

### Future Enhancements

**Short-term:**
1. **Weekly Streak Logic**: Count consecutive weeks instead of days
2. **Monthly Support**: Add monthly to toggle options
3. **Frequency History**: Track when frequency was changed
4. **Undo**: Allow reverting frequency change

**Medium-term:**
1. **Custom Frequencies**: "Every 3 days", "Twice per week", etc.
2. **Frequency Analytics**: Show which frequency works best for user
3. **Smart Suggestions**: "You log most on weekends - try weekly?"
4. **Frequency Presets**: Templates for common patterns

**Long-term:**
1. **Adaptive Frequency**: AI suggests optimal frequency based on patterns
2. **Frequency Experiments**: A/B test different frequencies
3. **Social Comparison**: "Most users succeed with daily check-ins"
