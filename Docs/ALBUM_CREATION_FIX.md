# Album Creation Functionality Fix

## Date: January 7, 2025

## Summary
Fixed two critical issues with the Album creation functionality in the Group Hub (TribePage):
1. **Database Error**: Missing `group_photo_albums` and `group_photos` tables in the dev database
2. **Button Visibility**: Delete buttons were invisible by default (only visible on hover)

---

## Problem 1: Database Error (PGRST205)

### Issue
When clicking "Create Album" button, the UI showed no response and DevTools displayed this error:
```json
{
    "code": "PGRST205",
    "details": null,
    "hint": "Perhaps you meant the table 'public.photo_albums'",
    "message": "Could not find the table 'public.group_photo_albums' in the schema cache"
}
```

### Root Cause
The migration file `supabase/migrations/20250107000001_tribe_community_hub_schema.sql` existed locally but had **not been applied** to the dev Supabase database (ohlscdojhsifvnnkoiqi).

The code in `src/lib/services/groupPhotos.ts` was correctly referencing `group_photo_albums` and `group_photos` tables, but these tables didn't exist in the database.

### Solution
Applied the complete migration to the dev database, which created:

#### New Tables:
1. **`group_photo_albums`** - Stores photo albums for groups
   - Columns: id, group_id, title, description, cover_photo_url, created_by, created_at, updated_at
   - Constraints: title length (1-100 chars)

2. **`group_photos`** - Stores individual photos within albums
   - Columns: id, album_id, user_id, photo_url, caption, created_at
   - Constraints: caption length (max 500 chars)

3. **`group_events`** - Stores group events (bonus feature)
   - Columns: id, group_id, title, description, start_time, end_time, location_type, location_details, event_image_url, created_by, created_at, updated_at

4. **`event_rsvps`** - Stores RSVP responses for events (bonus feature)
   - Columns: event_id, user_id, status, created_at, updated_at

#### New ENUM Types:
- `event_location_type` - ('virtual', 'physical')
- `rsvp_status` - ('going', 'not_going')

#### RLS Policies Applied:

**group_photo_albums:**
- ✅ Group members can view albums in their groups
- ✅ Group members can create albums
- ✅ Album creators and group admins can update albums
- ✅ Album creators and group admins can delete albums

**group_photos:**
- ✅ Group members can view photos in albums from their groups
- ✅ Group members can upload photos to albums in their groups
- ✅ Photo uploaders and group admins can delete photos

**group_events:**
- ✅ Group members can view events in their groups
- ✅ Group admins can create events
- ✅ Group admins can update events
- ✅ Group admins can delete events

**event_rsvps:**
- ✅ Group members can view RSVPs for events in their groups
- ✅ Group members can create their own RSVPs
- ✅ Users can update their own RSVPs
- ✅ Users can delete their own RSVPs

### Verification
Confirmed tables were created successfully:
```sql
SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables 
WHERE table_schema = 'public' 
AND table_name IN ('group_photo_albums', 'group_photos', 'group_events', 'event_rsvps');
```

Result: ✅ All 4 tables exist

## Problem 2: Button Visibility Issue

### Issue
Delete buttons on album cards and photo thumbnails were invisible by default and only appeared on hover due to `opacity-0 group-hover:opacity-100` classes.

### Files Modified

#### 1. `src/components/tribe/AlbumGallery.tsx` (Line 144)
**Before:**
```tsx
className="absolute top-2 right-2 p-2 bg-red-500 hover:bg-red-600 text-white rounded-lg opacity-0 group-hover:opacity-100 transition-opacity"
```

**After:**
```tsx
className="absolute top-2 right-2 p-2 bg-red-500 hover:bg-red-600 text-white rounded-lg shadow-lg transition-all hover:scale-110"
```

**Changes:**
- ❌ Removed: `opacity-0 group-hover:opacity-100 transition-opacity`
- ✅ Added: `shadow-lg transition-all hover:scale-110`

**Result:** Delete button on album cards is now always visible with a subtle scale animation on hover

#### 2. `src/components/tribe/AlbumView.tsx` (Line 190)
**Before:**
```tsx
className="absolute top-2 right-2 p-2 bg-red-500 hover:bg-red-600 text-white rounded-lg opacity-0 group-hover:opacity-100 transition-opacity"
```

**After:**
```tsx
className="absolute top-2 right-2 p-2 bg-red-500 hover:bg-red-600 text-white rounded-lg shadow-lg transition-all hover:scale-110"
```

**Changes:**
- ❌ Removed: `opacity-0 group-hover:opacity-100 transition-opacity`
- ✅ Added: `shadow-lg transition-all hover:scale-110`

**Result:** Delete button on photo thumbnails is now always visible with a subtle scale animation on hover

### Design Rationale
- **Always Visible**: Users can immediately see which items they can delete without needing to hover
- **Red Color**: Maintains the existing red color (`bg-red-500`) to indicate destructive action
- **Shadow**: Added `shadow-lg` for better visual separation from the background
- **Hover Effect**: Replaced opacity transition with a subtle scale effect (`hover:scale-110`) for better UX feedback

## Notes

### Color Scheme
The app uses the following accent color for primary action buttons:
- **Accent/Orange**: `#f97316` (sunrise-500)
- Used for: Create Album, Upload Photos, and other primary actions
- Defined in: `tailwind.config.js` as `accent` color palette

### Multi-Tenant Architecture
The group photo albums follow the platform's multi-tenant model:
- **Tenants** → **Groups** → **Albums** → **Photos**
- RLS policies ensure users only see albums from groups they're members of
- SuperUsers have access to all albums across all groups

### Future Enhancements
1. **Batch Photo Upload**: Allow uploading multiple photos at once
2. **Album Sorting**: Add ability to sort albums by date, name, or photo count
3. **Photo Captions**: Add inline editing for photo captions
4. **Album Sharing**: Add ability to share albums with other groups
5. **Photo Reactions**: Add emoji reactions to photos
