# How Groups Are Associated with Users

**Date**: 2025-01-07  
**Question**: "How are Groups associated with a user_profile? I don't see any Group column?"

---

## 🎯 Quick Answer

**There is NO `group_id` column in `user_profiles`** - and that's by design!

Groups are associated with users through a **separate junction table** called `group_memberships`. This allows:
- ✅ Users to belong to **multiple groups**
- ✅ Groups to have **multiple members**
- ✅ Each membership to have a **role** (ADMIN or MEMBER)

---

## 📊 The Relationship: Many-to-Many

### Database Schema

```
user_profiles (1) ←→ (Many) group_memberships (Many) ←→ (1) groups
```

**Tables involved**:

1. **`user_profiles`** - User identity and profile data
   - `user_id` (FK to auth.users)
   - `display_name`, `bio`, `avatar_url`, etc.
   - **NO group_id column!**

2. **`group_memberships`** - Junction table (the "glue")
   - `user_id` (FK to auth.users)
   - `group_id` (FK to groups)
   - `role` (ADMIN or MEMBER)
   - `created_at`

3. **`groups`** - Group data
   - `id` (PK)
   - `tenant_id` (FK to tenants)
   - `name`
   - `description`

## 💡 Why Use a Junction Table?

### Problem: Direct Foreign Key Doesn't Work

**If we added `group_id` to `user_profiles`**:
```sql
-- ❌ BAD: Can only belong to ONE group
user_profiles:
  user_id: uuid
  group_id: uuid  -- Can only store ONE group!
```

**Limitations**:
- ❌ User can only be in ONE group
- ❌ Can't have different roles in different groups
- ❌ Can't track when user joined each group

### Solution: Junction Table (Many-to-Many)

**Using `group_memberships` junction table**:
```sql
-- ✅ GOOD: Can belong to MULTIPLE groups
group_memberships:
  user_id: uuid
  group_id: uuid
  role: text (ADMIN or MEMBER)
  created_at: timestamp
```

**Benefits**:
- ✅ User can be in multiple groups
- ✅ Each membership has its own role
- ✅ Track when user joined each group
- ✅ Easy to add/remove from groups

## 🔗 How to Query Group Memberships

### Get All Groups for a User

```sql
-- Get all groups that Abraham Lincoln is in
SELECT 
  g.name as group_name,
  g.description,
  gm.role as my_role,
  t.name as tenant_name
FROM group_memberships gm
JOIN groups g ON gm.group_id = g.id
LEFT JOIN tenants t ON g.tenant_id = t.id
WHERE gm.user_id = '1a2741bb-8dfb-470e-b1b4-f66b7b8c8088'  -- Abraham Lincoln
ORDER BY g.name;
```

**Result**:
```
group_name: Matterdaddies
description: This is where the magic happens
my_role: MEMBER
tenant_name: Top of the World Ranch
```

### Get All Members of a Group

```sql
-- Get all members of Matterdaddies group
SELECT 
  up.display_name,
  up.email,
  gm.role as group_role,
  gm.created_at as joined_at
FROM group_memberships gm
JOIN user_profiles up ON gm.user_id = up.user_id
WHERE gm.group_id = '4cd09d6c-c212-4662-8a4d-fad4cbe84052'  -- Matterdaddies
ORDER BY up.display_name;
```

**Result**:
```
6 members:
- Abraham Lincoln (MEMBER)
- Alfred E Newman (MEMBER)
- Higher Power Hank (MEMBER)
- Jim Sherlock (MEMBER)
- Kirk Ferentz (MEMBER)
- Navin R Johnson (MEMBER)
```

### Get Group Count Per User

```sql
-- Count how many groups each user is in
SELECT 
  up.display_name,
  COUNT(gm.group_id) as group_count,
  array_agg(g.name) as groups
FROM user_profiles up
LEFT JOIN group_memberships gm ON up.user_id = gm.user_id
LEFT JOIN groups g ON gm.group_id = g.id
GROUP BY up.user_id, up.display_name
ORDER BY group_count DESC;
```

**Result**:
```
All 7 users are in exactly 1 group each
```

## 🏗️ Multi-Tenant Architecture

### Hierarchy: Tenants → Groups → Users

```
Tenant (Facility)
  ├── Group 1
  │   ├── User A (ADMIN)
  │   ├── User B (MEMBER)
  │   └── User C (MEMBER)
  └── Group 2
      ├── User D (ADMIN)
      └── User E (MEMBER)
```

**Your Current Structure**:

```
Top of the World Ranch (Tenant)
  └── Matterdaddies (Group)
      ├── Abraham Lincoln (MEMBER)
      ├── Alfred E Newman (MEMBER)
      ├── Higher Power Hank (MEMBER)
      ├── Jim Sherlock (MEMBER)
      ├── Kirk Ferentz (MEMBER)
      └── Navin R Johnson (MEMBER)

Test Facility (Tenant)
  └── Knuckleheads (Group)
      └── James Sherlock Cybercade (MEMBER)
```

### Key Constraints

1. **Groups belong to ONE tenant**
   - `groups.tenant_id` → `tenants.id`
   - Groups can't span multiple facilities

2. **Users can be in MULTIPLE groups**
   - But only within their tenant
   - Solo users (tenant_id = NULL) can't join groups

3. **Each membership has a role**
   - `ADMIN` - Can manage group settings and members
   - `MEMBER` - Regular group member

## 📝 How Your App Uses This

### In DevModePanel.tsx

**Step 1: Fetch user's groups**
```typescript
const { data: userGroups } = await supabase
  .from('group_memberships')
  .select('group_id, groups(name)')
  .eq('user_id', user.userId);
```

**Step 2: Fetch members for each group**
```typescript
// Get user_ids in the group
const { data: memberships } = await supabase
  .from('group_memberships')
  .select('user_id')
  .eq('group_id', group.group_id);

// Get profiles for those user_ids
const userIds = memberships.map(m => m.user_id);
const { data: profiles } = await supabase
  .from('user_profiles')
  .select('user_id, display_name, email')
  .in('user_id', userIds);
```

**Why two queries?**
- No direct FK between `group_memberships` and `user_profiles`
- Both reference `auth.users.id`, but not each other
- Two-step approach is explicit and reliable

## 🎯 Key Takeaways

### 1. **No group_id in user_profiles is CORRECT**
- Users can belong to multiple groups
- Junction table `group_memberships` handles the relationship
- This is standard database design for many-to-many relationships

### 2. **Three tables work together**
- `user_profiles` - Who you are
- `groups` - What groups exist
- `group_memberships` - Who's in which groups

### 3. **Each membership is independent**
- Has its own role (ADMIN or MEMBER)
- Has its own created_at timestamp
- Can be added/removed independently

### 4. **Groups are scoped to tenants**
- Groups belong to one facility (tenant)
- Users can only join groups in their tenant
- Solo users (tenant_id = NULL) can't join groups

### 5. **Your current state**
- 2 groups total
- 7 users, all in exactly 1 group each
- All memberships have role = MEMBER
- No group admins yet

## 🚀 Common Operations

### Add User to Group

```sql
INSERT INTO group_memberships (user_id, group_id, role)
VALUES (
  '1a2741bb-8dfb-470e-b1b4-f66b7b8c8088',  -- Abraham Lincoln
  '4cd09d6c-c212-4662-8a4d-fad4cbe84052',  -- Matterdaddies
  'MEMBER'
);
```

### Remove User from Group

```sql
DELETE FROM group_memberships
WHERE user_id = '1a2741bb-8dfb-470e-b1b4-f66b7b8c8088'
  AND group_id = '4cd09d6c-c212-4662-8a4d-fad4cbe84052';
```

### Promote User to Group Admin

```sql
UPDATE group_memberships
SET role = 'ADMIN'
WHERE user_id = '1a2741bb-8dfb-470e-b1b4-f66b7b8c8088'
  AND group_id = '4cd09d6c-c212-4662-8a4d-fad4cbe84052';
```

### Get All Groups User Can Join (in their tenant)

```sql
-- Get all groups in Abraham Lincoln's tenant that he's NOT in yet
SELECT g.*
FROM groups g
WHERE g.tenant_id = 'a77d4b1b-7e8d-48e2-b509-b305c5615f4d'  -- Top of the World Ranch
  AND g.id NOT IN (
    SELECT group_id 
    FROM group_memberships 
    WHERE user_id = '1a2741bb-8dfb-470e-b1b4-f66b7b8c8088'
  );
```

## 🎉 Summary

**Question**: "How are Groups associated with a user_profile? I don't see any Group column?"

**Answer**: 
- ✅ Groups are associated via `group_memberships` junction table
- ✅ No `group_id` column in `user_profiles` (by design)
- ✅ Allows many-to-many relationship (users in multiple groups)
- ✅ Each membership has its own role and timestamp
- ✅ Standard database design pattern for this type of relationship

**Your current setup**:
- 2 groups (Matterdaddies with 6 members, Knuckleheads with 1 member)
- All users in exactly 1 group
- All memberships are MEMBER role (no admins yet)
- Groups scoped to their respective tenants
