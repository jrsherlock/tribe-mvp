# SuperUser Unlimited Facilities - RESOLVED

## ✅ Status: COMPLETE

**Date**: October 3, 2025  
**Priority**: CRITICAL - Blocking customer onboarding  
**Issue**: SuperUsers were blocked from creating multiple facilities

---

## Executive Summary

Fixed the `create_tenant()` function to allow SuperUsers to create unlimited facilities while maintaining the single-facility restriction for regular users. This enables SuperUsers to onboard new customers without being blocked by the single-tenant-per-user constraint.

---

## Problem Statement

### Error Encountered

When a SuperUser tried to create a second facility, they received this error:

```json
{
    "code": "P0001",
    "details": null,
    "hint": "If you need to switch facilities, please contact your administrator.",
    "message": "You already belong to a facility. Each user can only create or belong to one facility at a time."
}
```

### Root Cause

The `create_tenant()` function enforced the single-facility restriction on **ALL users**, including SuperUsers. This prevented SuperUsers from creating multiple facilities for customer onboarding.

**Previous Implementation** (Lines 27-44 of old function):
```sql
-- Check if user already has a tenant membership
SELECT * INTO existing_membership
FROM tenant_members
WHERE user_id = auth.uid();

IF FOUND THEN
  RAISE EXCEPTION 'You already belong to a facility...'
    USING 
      HINT = 'If you need to switch facilities, please contact your administrator.',
      ERRCODE = 'P0001';
END IF;
```

**Problem**: This check applied to ALL users without distinguishing SuperUsers.

---

## Solution Implemented

### Updated create_tenant() Function

**File**: `supabase/migrations/20251003043346_allow_superusers_unlimited_facilities.sql`

**Key Changes**:

1. **Added SuperUser Check** (Line 29):
   ```sql
   SELECT app.is_superuser() INTO is_super_user;
   ```

2. **Conditional Restriction** (Lines 33-45):
   ```sql
   IF NOT is_super_user THEN
     -- Check if regular user already has a tenant membership
     SELECT * INTO existing_membership
     FROM tenant_members
     WHERE user_id = auth.uid();
     
     IF FOUND THEN
       RAISE EXCEPTION 'You already belong to a facility...'
         USING 
           HINT = 'If you need to switch facilities, please contact your administrator.',
           ERRCODE = 'P0001';
     END IF;
   END IF;
   ```

3. **SuperUsers Bypass Restriction**:
   - SuperUsers skip the membership check entirely
   - They can create unlimited facilities
   - Each facility creation adds a new OWNER membership for the SuperUser

### Helper Function Used

**Function**: `app.is_superuser()`  
**Schema**: `app`  
**Returns**: `boolean`  
**Type**: `STABLE SQL`

**Definition**:
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION app.is_superuser()
RETURNS boolean
LANGUAGE sql
STABLE
AS $function$
  SELECT EXISTS(SELECT 1 FROM public.superusers WHERE user_id = auth.uid());
$function$
```

**How it works**:
- Checks if `auth.uid()` (current authenticated user) exists in `superusers` table
- Returns `TRUE` if user is a SuperUser
- Returns `FALSE` if user is a regular user
- Uses `auth.uid()` which is set by Supabase Auth for authenticated requests

| User Type     | Existing Memberships | Can Create Facility? | Result                                    |
|---------------|---------------------|---------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| SuperUser     | 0                   | ✅ YES              | Creates facility, becomes OWNER           |
| SuperUser     | 1                   | ✅ YES              | Creates facility, becomes OWNER (2nd)     |
| SuperUser     | 2+                  | ✅ YES              | Creates facility, becomes OWNER (3rd+)    |
| Regular User  | 0                   | ✅ YES              | Creates facility, becomes OWNER           |
| Regular User  | 1                   | ❌ NO               | Error: "You already belong to a facility" |
| Regular User  | 2+                  | ❌ NO               | Error: "You already belong to a facility" |

## Testing Instructions

### Test 1: SuperUser Creates First Facility ✅

**Scenario**: SuperUser with no existing facilities creates their first facility

**Steps**:
1. Log in as a SuperUser (user in `superusers` table)
2. Navigate to `/tenant/setup`
3. Fill in facility name: "Customer A Facility"
4. Fill in slug: "customer-a"
5. Click "Create Facility"

**Expected Result**:
- ✅ Facility created successfully
- ✅ Toast: "Facility created!"
- ✅ SuperUser assigned as OWNER
- ✅ Redirects to `/groups`

**Verification SQL**:
```sql
SELECT tm.*, t.name as tenant_name 
FROM tenant_members tm 
JOIN tenants t ON tm.tenant_id = t.id 
WHERE tm.user_id = auth.uid();
-- Should show 1 membership
```

---

### Test 2: SuperUser Creates Second Facility ✅

**Scenario**: SuperUser with existing facility creates another facility (customer onboarding)

**Steps**:
1. Log in as a SuperUser who already has a facility
2. Navigate to `/tenant/setup`
3. Fill in facility name: "Customer B Facility"
4. Fill in slug: "customer-b"
5. Click "Create Facility"

**Expected Result**:
- ✅ Facility created successfully (NO ERROR!)
- ✅ Toast: "Facility created!"
- ✅ SuperUser assigned as OWNER of new facility
- ✅ Redirects to `/groups`
- ✅ SuperUser now has 2 OWNER memberships

**Verification SQL**:
```sql
SELECT tm.*, t.name as tenant_name 
FROM tenant_members tm 
JOIN tenants t ON tm.tenant_id = t.id 
WHERE tm.user_id = auth.uid()
ORDER BY tm.created_at;
-- Should show 2 memberships (both with role='OWNER')
```

---

### Test 3: SuperUser Creates Third+ Facility ✅

**Scenario**: SuperUser creates unlimited facilities

**Steps**:
1. Repeat Test 2 with different facility names
2. Create "Customer C Facility", "Customer D Facility", etc.

**Expected Result**:
- ✅ All facilities created successfully
- ✅ No errors or restrictions
- ✅ SuperUser has multiple OWNER memberships

**Verification SQL**:
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) as facility_count
FROM tenant_members 
WHERE user_id = auth.uid();
-- Should show 3, 4, 5, etc.
```

---

### Test 4: Regular User Creates First Facility ✅

**Scenario**: Regular user (not SuperUser) creates their first facility

**Steps**:
1. Log in as a regular user (NOT in `superusers` table)
2. Navigate to `/tenant/setup`
3. Fill in facility name: "My Recovery Center"
4. Fill in slug: "my-recovery"
5. Click "Create Facility"

**Expected Result**:
- ✅ Facility created successfully
- ✅ Toast: "Facility created!"
- ✅ User assigned as OWNER
- ✅ Redirects to `/groups`

**Verification SQL**:
```sql
-- Check user is NOT a SuperUser
SELECT * FROM superusers WHERE user_id = auth.uid();
-- Should return 0 rows

-- Check user has 1 membership
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM tenant_members WHERE user_id = auth.uid();
-- Should return 1
```

---

### Test 5: Regular User Tries to Create Second Facility ❌

**Scenario**: Regular user with existing facility tries to create another (should be blocked)

**Steps**:
1. Log in as a regular user who already has a facility
2. Navigate to `/tenant/setup`
3. Fill in facility name: "Another Facility"
4. Fill in slug: "another-facility"
5. Click "Create Facility"

**Expected Result**:
- ❌ Facility creation fails
- ✅ Toast: "You already have a facility. Each user can only belong to one facility."
- ✅ After 2 seconds, redirects to `/groups`
- ✅ No new facility created in database

**Verification SQL**:
```sql
-- Check user still has only 1 membership
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM tenant_members WHERE user_id = auth.uid();
-- Should still return 1 (not 2)
```

## Business Impact

### Before Fix ❌

**SuperUser Experience**:
- ❌ Blocked from creating second facility
- ❌ Cannot onboard new customers
- ❌ Must use workarounds or manual database edits
- ❌ Poor customer onboarding experience

**Regular User Experience**:
- ✅ Correctly limited to one facility
- ✅ Clear error messages

---

### After Fix ✅

**SuperUser Experience**:
- ✅ Can create unlimited facilities
- ✅ Smooth customer onboarding workflow
- ✅ Each customer gets their own facility
- ✅ SuperUser maintains OWNER access to all facilities
- ✅ No workarounds needed

**Regular User Experience**:
- ✅ Still correctly limited to one facility
- ✅ Clear error messages maintained
- ✅ No change in behavior

---

## Use Cases Enabled

### Use Case 1: Customer Onboarding
**Scenario**: SuperUser onboards a new recovery center as a customer

**Workflow**:
1. SuperUser logs in
2. Creates new facility for "ABC Recovery Center"
3. Becomes OWNER of ABC Recovery Center
4. Invites ABC staff as ADMIN/MEMBER users
5. ABC staff can now manage their facility
6. SuperUser retains OWNER access for support

**Result**: ✅ Enabled by this fix

---

### Use Case 2: Multi-Facility Management
**Scenario**: SuperUser manages multiple customer facilities

**Workflow**:
1. SuperUser has OWNER access to 10+ facilities
2. Can switch between facilities in the UI
3. Can create groups, manage users, view data in each facility
4. Provides support across all customer facilities

**Result**: ✅ Enabled by this fix

---

### Use Case 3: Demo/Testing Facilities
**Scenario**: SuperUser creates demo facilities for testing

**Workflow**:
1. SuperUser creates "Demo Facility" for testing
2. Creates "Training Facility" for staff training
3. Creates "Staging Facility" for QA
4. All facilities isolated from production customer data

**Result**: ✅ Enabled by this fix

---

## Security Considerations

### Access Control Maintained ✅

1. **SuperUser Privilege Required**:
   - Only users in `superusers` table can create unlimited facilities
   - Regular users still restricted to one facility
   - No privilege escalation possible

2. **Tenant Isolation Maintained**:
   - Each facility remains isolated via RLS policies
   - SuperUser OWNER access doesn't bypass RLS
   - Users in one facility cannot see data from other facilities

3. **Audit Trail**:
   - All facility creations logged in `tenants` table
   - All memberships logged in `tenant_members` table
   - SuperUser actions traceable via `created_at` timestamps

---

## Summary

✅ **SuperUser unlimited facilities feature successfully implemented!**

**What Changed**:
- ✅ `create_tenant()` function now checks SuperUser status
- ✅ SuperUsers bypass single-facility restriction
- ✅ Regular users still limited to one facility
- ✅ Clear separation of SuperUser vs regular user behavior
